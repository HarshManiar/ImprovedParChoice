thanks for tuning in to the model 3 unveil part 1! part 2 is super next level, but that's for later
btw, foster the people is playing the model x event tonight. seemed like the right vibe.
for their test drive, the motor trend team drove from la to san diego and back without recharging  
@icannot_enough @flcnhvy @tesla your insights over the years have been excellent. thats approximately right.
@tallakt various forms of shades are being considered. may not be necessary though.
@andyzalk sounds like the right name for the rocket booster
@justpaulinelol not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as mars is slightly too far from this solar systems fusion reactor (the sun).
@teslarati @residentsponge it will still be very intense, just slightly less than in the past
nan
@teslany sandy munro knows what hes talking about
@theonion 
but credit for 1st reusable suborbital rocket goes to x-15  
@djsnm @rockettenor @nasa @spacex @space_station @commercial_crew for cargo missions, propulsive land landing should be no problem. doesnt have same safety criticality as crew.
critical test launch before flying astronauts is green for jan 18
jupiter is big  
@davidshepardson @bw @att @toysrus exactly :)
@martinapennisi @serdarsprofile @brianacton instagrams probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. i dont use fb &amp; never have, so dont think im some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. also, we dont advertise or pay for endorsements, so  dont care.
@ricardorossello i would be happy to talk. hopefully, tesla can be helpful.
@roadandtrack @teslamotors model y (compact suv) off model 3 chassis. tesla bus/minibus/spacebus off model x.
turns out that gun is for the toilet paper

@iamjefftorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @vitalikbuterin yeah, i think we pretty much agree. btw, great show.
maybe the media credibility rating site should be called youre right!  i do actually own  
@petergleick @business first i've heard of this meeting. will find out why.
@teslaownerssv haha true! the top alternate name, if we couldnt acquire the tesla motors trademark, was faraday, which a competitor ended up using.
abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. adjusting thresholds and restarting count at t-10 mins.
@ang3lwtf yup, we are extending the net area by a factor of 4
nan
for their test drive, the motor trend team drove from la to san diego and back without recharging  
am standing on the beach in maui and looking at a moon rainbow for the first time in my life. incredibly beautiful.
@roymoody depends on regulatory approval, but hopefully end of next week
@wonderofscience it sure does. very reliable.
@id_aa_carmack no choice. entry velocity too high for a precision landing with n2 thrusters alone. must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
@wholemarsblog if you dont say anything &amp; engage autopilot, it will soon guess based on time of day, taking you home or to work or to whats on your calendar
@reecethesaxman @youfoundalec @ev_stevee @teslaownerssv @cgpgrey write games
@fredericlambert @woodhaus2 production design will be better, especially in details. we are dying to do this, but primary focus must remain on making affordable version of model 3 &amp; bringing y to market
@28delayslater @whatsupfranks @spacex 
@lexfridman summarized well
@erdayastronaut @spacex all correct. parachutes were originally the backup landing system, with superdraco thrusters as primary. difficulty of proving thruster landing safety *and* architecture being suboptimal for moon/mars caused us to change focus to parachutes.
@jovanik21 @arstechnica @drgitlin sounds like a great move!
@mark_goldberg_ @tesla note the fabulous plaid jacket &amp; gingham shirt combo

@skorusark really just comes down to iron  cathode for medium range vehicles &amp; stationary storage vs nickel cathode for long range vehicles
@brandonjhavard there is no refreshed model x or model s coming, only a series of minor ongoing changes. most significant change in past few years was to use high efficiency model 3 rear drive unit as s/x front drive unit. that went into production 3 months ago.
@tylerthecreator thanks for ordering a car!
@janeidyeve yes. those videos are from this morning.

@omgrofloljk good point

@eforelectric @wsj that tweet did take immense effort  fair point tho. powerwall production is now ramping fast. tesla was cell-starved last year, so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars, which meant powerwall production was living off scraps.
@erdayastronaut @annerajb no, were building a bfr dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in boca chica, texas
@cyantist where are they?
@kaaningilamo our existence cannot just be about solving one miserable problem after another. there need to be reasons to live.
@icannot_enough @flcnhvy @tesla autopilot was trapped in a local maximum, labeling single camera images uncorrelated in time. now, it is not.
@freddier btw, credit for the boring company name goes to @talulahriley
a life well lived  
rocket fairing returning from space
this piece about mars in the nyt is worth a read  
@vincent13031925 @teslarati @panasonic tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at china giga, as we do today in california &amp; nevada. cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner.
@billhuang688 @f9block5 @ppathole fsd beta build v8.1 normally drives me around with no interventions. next version is a big step change beyond that. tesla is solving a major part of real-world ai. this is not widely known.
@andrewkemendo govts don't need to follow normal laws. they will obtain ai developed by companies at gunpoint, if necessary.
@tomekdrabas @merkinvineyards they have the best merkins
falcon 9 experienced a problem shortly before first stage shutdown. will provide more info as soon as we review the data.

@teslaclubla @philbrock4sm @samomayor @samomanager hoping to get this done soon
@erdayastronaut @djsnm @kevinkling12 @spacexcentric distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you havent moved far even if a is high. at ~6g thrust, youll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. if you can fly out of it, youre prob ok.

tesla history trivia: we didnt actually come up with the tesla motors name. bought trademark off brad siewert for $75k in late 2004. hed originally filed for it in 1994. our alternative name was faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later.

@emilmelar retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the tesla fsd computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. for now, its slightly disadvantageous to have tesla fsd computer, as our software is more refined for hw2.

and, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. because its electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.

@teslarati @klenderjoey sorry to tesla beta users for the trouble! issue turned out to be power saving mode interacting with fsd.   our internal qa fleet didnt see this, because cars are constantly in use, so very rarely enter power saving mode. internal qa will obv test this case going forward.
the tesla truck will have dual motor all-wheel drive w crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. those will be standard.

maybe already under control, but tesla &amp; spacex are happy to help with the 787 lithium ion batteries.
@johnkrausphotos definitely further refinements coming to (early beta) safety test score. it will be refined continuously until it is an extremely good predictor of crash probability. exciting actuarial problem!

@scottymeuk @scaleymurrsuit no, its got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original roadster. still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered.
@meddd__ @aaronpaul_8 watched the whole series. one of the best tv shows ever.

@thereal_scottv yeah, thats our problem. service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks.
testing the boring company car elevator  
@cleantechnica congrats to nio. that is a tough milestone.
@zatulsky shai actually got the idea from a visit to tesla. the idea is obvious (many things allow battery swap), but the technology is not.
@xjawz @joerogan yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output.

@nasaspaceflight @ianpineapple yeah, will be raptor vertical test stand. hopefully allows simplification of raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. also, more representive of flight. test as you fly 
after safety, our goal is to make a tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car

@sciguyspace especially for boost stage, which is volumetrically constrained, ch4 is way better than h2. soviet ch4 engine prototypes from 80s were very advanced. glad to see reusability is being factored in.
@owensparks_ @shillforvegas @boringcompany @lvcva sick burn haha. hopefully, next year.
@johnnacrider1 exactly. default autopilot behavior, if theres no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. tesla service then contacts the owner. looking into what happened here.

@snazzyq @phenomenalpoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech straw man fallacy. to appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. fsd will be bundled in all cars (important point). something is not a commodity if you cant make enough of them &amp; we wont be able to.
crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. easy to replace (if falcon makes it back to port).

@arstechnica @sciguyspace falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. when it has spare performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.  our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. last year, spacex launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world.

@flcnhvy @hoofhrtd1254 @teslatunity @model3owners agreed
will do another static fire of rocket to make sure all is good &amp; af needs to test icbms, so probable launch sept 29/30.
@erdayastronaut @caspar_stanley probably slightly further forward, smaller, more inward. no funny looking static aero at top, as static aero no longer directly in flow.
@kpe @spacex @grierallen @natedapore cool, thanks for letting us know. this is helpful for figuring out fairing reusability.
@kenjennings all other car companies are allowed to manufacture *except* tesla, you knucklehead. no wonder you got crushed by a computer the size of a pizza box.

@adamklotz_ @ppathole good idea. they are not easy to move over roads, which is why the factory is close to the launch site, but we will support a museum that wants a prototype if they take care of transport.
@rstar346 @elonmusknt @phil343thomas @tonywugz @tesla no need, top gear already did  
@keithbigelow very sensible summary of supersonic flight. obvious answer is to fly high, which gives low drag &amp; low boom amplitude at ground. if boom too loud, airframe design probably wrong too.

@chromejs10 should start changing soon
moonbow's are real, btw. i'm not on acid :) here is what we saw:  
if you have a tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try navigate on autopilot. it will blow your mind. automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps.
spacex and tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory.   
should mention that i will be interviewing people personally and autopilot reports directly to me. this is a super high priority.
@_cgp @spacex propellant was not deep cryo. ch4 &amp; o2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. in theory, raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. however, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of starship/super heavy.
@zedd will send you one
@malkosh was this in a test drive car (those are all about to be upgraded) or a current customer car?
oh yeah, well tesla will study a plan to study the gm team that's studying tesla, so there!  
we called manual abort. better to be paranoid and wrong. bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
not saying it solves everything, mind you, but its a step in the right direction
should mention that tesla motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. this was completely independent.
launch to the space station in just under three hours if weather holds  
model 3 standard range+ with autopilot lease is $399/month at  
mostly accurate and fun movie about mars. worth seeing.  
@vivek_17m @thanr the pumps i saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. they stopped shortly after boys were rescued &amp; water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. that was great work.
what i love about the boring company are the low expectations. nowhere to go but down.
model s limits torque if brake &amp; accel simul pressed. going to zero torque with brake press would be a safety hazard.

@amyceskridge neuralink wont overclock the brain, it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain. this is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer, but a neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input &amp; output, especially latter.
please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :)  this is actually me.
falcon heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads.

@lanceulanoff front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. you can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good.

@spacex unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the keep out zone, which is unreasonably gigantic.   there is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. the current regulatory system is broken.
@kennyloaded @billym2k some engineers i worked with went on to help create wow, but it was too addicting. couldnt afford the time (sigh).

@teslacharts how big is your short position? just curious.
@money23green thanks for coming by our car factory with @westcoastbill. tesla team was super fired up to see you! congrats on your victory!!
@terminalcount one of the greatest things ive ever seen
launch in ~1.5 hours if weather clears. lightning tower struck earlier, but no effect on rocket or satellite

@rsorokanich @roadandtrack sorry about that. you certainly should have been. will get you guys in a car right away.
@business incorrect. chairman is an honorific, not executive role, which means its not needed to run tesla. will retire that title at tesla in 3 years. 60 mins edited out end of my sentence, where i said i could do whatever i want. they cut provided i have the support of shareholders.

@id_aa_carmack i hope so. wings dont work on the moon at all and def not well on mars. also, no runways.
rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way
last known state for rocket boost stage is 360 m/s, mach 1.1, 8.5 km altitude and roll rate close to zero (v important!)

@dasbub @sigitconsult @tesla reddit is hardcore. mostly correct analysis. comments so dark 
@cleantechnica  
that special hat delivery will take place deep within the real, but fictional (of course), tunnel we are building under la while you drive the giant machine blindfolded. this will actually happen.
launch can be viewed live from cape causeways or via  
@jlgolson yes, but it is false of merc news to say that tesla took advantage of low cost labor. we paid $55/hr. that is unequivocal.
@model3owners they will. we spent a lot of time on those.
@watcherstank @spacex with that, ship is basically begging for an extra 3 engines
@mfrunker @tesla yes
@teslagong @wintonark bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale.
@clovenlife no, but shielding got fragged every flight. more control authority is for falcon heavy, but also enables falcon 9 to land in heavier winds.
appreciate thoughtful @sulliview article. faith in @nytimes restored.

@electrekco @fredericlambert to be clear, actual nn improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. v9.0 vs v8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated gpu &amp; better use of discrete gpu.

@lifeboathq doubling diameter increases mass 4x, but difficulty of simultaneously building &amp; launching rocket of that size is &gt;&gt;4x.   in retrospect, &lt;9m diameter for starship might have been wise. current size is ~5200 ton stack mass &amp; ~7500 ton-f thrust, which is more than double saturn v.
@kpe @spacex @grierallen @natedapore cool, thanks for letting us know. this is helpful for figuring out fairing reusability.
@cardoso true, it is a no-win situation
ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. just not physically possible to return to launch site
@fredericlambert @frozencanuck @scaleymurrsuit in order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast
@nuovarealta if someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day 8, thats fine
@ismailnathij @stapf @tesla tesla always charges the same price for a powerwall (only taxes &amp; shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. i've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums.

@ajtourville main advantage of this is a much stronger em field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel).   other advantage is that rotor can go to higher rpm, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration.

@28delayslater @kounistou 10.1 should solve that last cone issue
@erdayastronaut @goathobbit high reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. no need to radiate heat away if you arent hot in the first place. also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective.
@poriya_ravi @worldandscience the actual amount of time i spend on twitter is tiny. my tweets are literally what im thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda.

@fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey spacex merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg ssme or rd), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. raptor has better isp, but im worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.

@jasonpolstein yeah, we don't do a good job of telling people about this feature. requires hardware unfortunately.
@janeidyeve @tesmanian_com nice work!
@electricfuture5 we face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. its not a question of money. if there was a great engineer factory, we would place a large order! unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. this is solved in the fsd build.

@robotbeat @ghotiing @cruizvinicius @josh119872 @sweetinxs @votelabonte @erdayastronaut @tesla tesla actually sent out resmed, philips &amp; medtronic units. latter is fully intratracheal. my personal opinion is that some icus are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting peep &amp; o2 too high. high pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage.  
@paulkrugman idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but arent (having phd in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. thats what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit expert.

@erdayastronaut @sciguyspace last launch aborted due to slightly high power. possibly, but not obviously, related to today. this vehicle has seen a lot of wear, so today isnt a big surprise. life leader rockets are used only for internal missions. wont risk non-spacex satellites.
@erdayastronaut yeah, starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. hard to see with naked eye. well do lots of flights.
@nebraskajr @ninja fwiw, based on calcs i did 10 years ago, cross-over point for li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 wh/kg. high cycle batteries are just over 300 wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years.

@challengerst @worldandscience 
@sciguyspace its a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market.

@ryaneshea possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. if someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.

@heretic_soul @model3owners leasing negatively effects tesla cash flow, so we prob wont offer model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but teslas have always had strong residual value.

@space_mog this makes no sense for many other reasons too. they dont actually have spectrum priority, they have shared spectrum &amp; nothing about this company is uk, except post office box. money would be better spent on actual uk satellite industry!

@lanceulanoff key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. this positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. extremely important metric.

@mkbhd @hyperchangetv the dry questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their tesla short thesis. they are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. hyperchange represented actual investors, so i switched to them.
@cleantechnica technically, i tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so elon musk tests negative for covid is an equally correct title. the rapid antigen test from bd seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.

@teslarati the source info is incorrect. starship &amp; raptor development is being done out of our hq in hawthorne, ca. we are building the starship prototypes locally at our launch site in texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport.

@littledovah yeah, exactly. so that makes it cool, right!?
@bbcworld moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, spacex engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time.
@mactechgenius going out this week for x and outside north america
headed to cape canaveral tomorrow for first @spacex geostationary satellite launch.

@mwolman98 later versions will
@whatsinside yes
@mattmedl sound reasoning
@id_aa_carmack maybe as a future optimization. would only matter if it was extremely big.
@robotbeat @john_gardi @spacex this will sound implausible, but i think theres a path to build starship / super heavy for less than falcon 9
@justpaulinelol @tesla same, except where limited by eu regulations. were aware of extreme consumer unhappiness about this &amp; are working with eu regulators to address.

@spexcast @sciguyspace whats amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. starship can travel by itself from surface of mars to surface of earth, but requires massive booster on earth with orbital refilling to get to mars, which is ~38% of earth gravity.

@madan3 we want to do so, but import duties are  the highest in the world by far of any large country!   moreover, clean energy vehicles are treated the same as diesel or petrol, which does not seem entirely consistent with the climate goals of india.

@smilesimplify umm...yes
@teslaownerssv sure
@cnn @gavinnewsom  
@john_gardi exactly
@erdayastronaut forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. if goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. no need to bring early ships back. they can serve as part of moon base alpha.
we are looking for hardcore software engineers. no prior experience with cars required. please include code sample or link to your work.

@cleantechnica good analysis. both computers will be used &amp; sync ~20 times per second. this is a long time to a computer. like a twin-engine plane, use both engines to max for normal operation, but can safely operate on just one.

@teslagong @teslaownerssv @teslatunity @tesla not sure we could go quite that tight, but we can for sure allow much narrower spaces at users discretion
@cosmic_penguin agreed, sent a note to starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. well get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun.
@rationaletienne @ppathole @fat__tire @kristennetten @robotbeat @ghotiing @cruizvinicius @josh119872 @sweetinxs @votelabonte @erdayastronaut @tesla does seem that early use is wise. solving late stage c19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.

most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good.
@readcoal @supernautical @flcnhvy @rationaletienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysrydave this is false. i landed in montreal at age 17 with $2000, a backpack of clothes &amp; suitcase of books. my father is bankrupt &amp; has been for a long time. i inherited literally nothing from him.  
@erdayastronaut btw, theres a slight error with forward flap design. moving section is needed for control, but passive section is counter-productive, as it pushes nose backwards.   new design rotates fwd flaps more to leeward &amp; further forward to improve moment arm. maybe ~120 deg apart.
@zperrin99 uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (rp-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed

@thirdrowtesla this number wont leave me alone! 
@sheldonth @factsdatatruth @tesla not exactly. we just bundled the upgrade package into performance. no problem if you want to return the car, but i think lifetime free supercharging is a good deal.
me &amp; other private money funded tesla for first 7 years, got ipo+ govt money for 3, now paid back. yes, carbon tax would be a better way.
@rengle820 model s p100d is def still the top end, but model 3 performance is higher value for money

@stevehurd yes
@g_whitehead5 @dmc_ryan @model3owners @tesla yes, awd p first and then awd. production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. as production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money.

@malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy no problem. we could program starship to perform swan lake in the sky. minimizing landing burn propellant mass is whats hard.

@erdayastronaut stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as acs thrusters. the smaller leeward fin would simply be used as a leg.

@sahilmalik that's how the tiles sit on the roof. there is no difference in strength for the tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).

@ajmarquez true, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all tesla cars ever produced (except early roadsters) will get improvements for free. continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a tesla retains so much value over time.

@justpaulinelol not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as mars is slightly too far from this solar systems fusion reactor (the sun).

@howlpolitically @theonion 2/2 my father &amp; his extended family have been dependent on financial support from my brother &amp; me for over 20 years.   this article is actually accurate:
autopilot 1.01 coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!
@marks22 thanks for the tip. his attention to detail is excellent.

@luciojr all tesla cars built since oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
if something is physically possible, not only is someone doing it, but there is also an award show.
@spacex very proud of the spacex team! cant believe its been fifty falcon 9 launches already. just ten years ago, we couldnt even reach orbit with little falcon 1.
@ryanjoyce88 we went through literally hundreds of variants of red trying to find something original that didn't suck.

@teslaownerssv the sheer amount of time tesla has spent dealing with bike lane is staggering. short answer  yes.
@_chrissimmons a carbon tax would affect coal even more than gasoline, so electricity would also become more expensive
@worldandscience earth should be called water. our surface is 71% water. mars land area is roughly equal to earth, as its all land. even when warmed up &amp; water ice turns liquid, mars will be about 2/3 land.

@lanceulanoff key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. this positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. extremely important metric.
@danahull very few. we have yet to do a china (or europe) launch of model 3.

@tsrandall incorrect. pana cell lines at giga are only at ~24gwh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on model 3 output since july. no choice but to use other suppliers for powerwall/powerpack cells. tesla wont spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35gwh theoretical.

@tapp697 thanks, important clarification. tesla announcements are always about making product experience better. market follows eventually.
@wapodavenport according to their own estimates, this tax only covers ~10% of the $3.5 trillion spending bill.   where will the other 90% come from?   the answer is you.
here is the latest spacex travel ad for the flight around the moon &amp; into deep space. maybe needs a few edits ...  
@ppathole @carlosv_resiste @pcgamer yeah, main story line is not that long. played at max difficulty, no aim assist, so didnt softball it. razor fight was insanely difficult.
hold down firing of dragon 2 spacecraft at cape canaveral  
@wapodavenport 16 flights is extremely unlikely. starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar starship.  without flaps &amp; heat shield, starship is much lighter. lunar landing legs dont add much (1/6 gravity). may only need 1/2 full, ie 4 tanker flights.

"real fraud going on is denial of climate science. as for ""subsidies"", tesla gets pennies on dollar vs coal. how about we both go to zero?"
@penenberg for sure! when doing us govt crash safety testing, the model s roof was so strong, it broke their testing machine.  
will be building a hyperloop test track for companies and student teams to test out their pods. most likely in texas.
@cleantechnica several finesse improvements coming to smart summon in coming weeks. will be smooth as silk.
anonymous bot swarms deserve a closer examination. if theyre evolving rapidly, somethings up.
@existentialcoms our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than tesla, which means tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as ev incentives declined. how strange

those improvements are independent of supercharger v3 power increase from 135kw to 250+kw. all factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole tesla fleet. effectively, this more than doubles total ww supercharger system throughput.

@alternatejones of course
aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. ship landings needed for high velocity missions  
i highly recommend the new all glass roof on the model s. this was very hard to develop, but it makes the interior feel amazing.  
@jasonwhansen @tesla yes
reason i believe this is likely is that correll first tried to work at spacex, but we turned him down. our competitor, it seems, did not.

@ludan27 @erdayastronaut @jeromejaccard @robotbeat @alan1bernard yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. add super heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. only need booster on earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. starship alone on moons &amp; mars.

@schaffffff flight 24 is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions.
to be clear, spacex is supporting a student design competition for stem, not trying to build hyperloop itself. other cos are doing latter.

@flcnhvy @alvianchoiri were not seeing notable differences yet. i think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. maybe turbopump hot sections.

starship test vehicle under assembly will look similar to this illustration when finished. operational starships would obv have windows, etc.

@ppathole many great suggestions in this thread!
@sparklingdisse1 @kimpaquette @cleantechnica i wish them well. track record in auto startups is tough. thousands of us auto startups, but only ford &amp; tesla have avoided bankruptcy. a similar scenario is likely in all countries.
@skorusark the factory is the product
@steveagee def on the cards for the future
@annerajb @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @shaynerarma @nasa will do it later this year. too much on plate right now. will be available as an upgrade from service.
@freddier btw, credit for the boring company name goes to @talulahriley
@indigoshrimp yay!
@spacex fairing halves recovered  
@disruptresearch tesla r&amp;d productivity is exceptionally good due to the caliber of engineering talent
@harrystoltz1 @sofiaan @iihs_autosafety @atj721 good question. nhtsa is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. ncap also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. super inside baseball stuff

target altitude of 40,600 km achieved. thanks @ses_satellites for riding on falcon 9! looking forward to future missions.
@danfromtheweb ok
@polybork @s8n haha
@asherlaw spacex is expanding launch ops at canaveral too. need 2 locations to handle flight rate and avoid weather risk
@aaronjoelgeorge @teslarati @klenderjoey the building is ~7 stores tall, so each floor is double size. hard to appreciate unless youre close.
@teslarati @residentsponge special mention of tesla china
@commoboy @spacex most people don't realize you can see dragon approach the space station from the ground, even in la
@grimmerkimmer @dpinsen given the extreme burn, shorts are pushing every possible fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt story

@noradio @mcornell0 @marks22 exactly
@rbrome @paulkrugman bloody hell, im going to have to write a blog. cant fit this into tweets.
@teslarati more software improvements coming
@alexberenson @neil_ferguson thanks! something more should be done. this guy has caused massive strife to the world with his absurdly fake science.

@chrisevans great thread 
good piece on volcanoes @danretz: the usgs would seem to disagree.  
@marshall5912 @buckycovington @mactechgenius about 2% of tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it.
final corner case is dealing with low contrast lane markings (faded white on grey concrete) while driving into the sun at dusk
@harrystoltz1 @neiltyson @space_station big challenge for starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.
@suzie_official yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people &amp; it's getting me down. i'm just trying to make a positive contribution &amp; hope good comes of it.
this is 1st ever orbital rocket launch w landing legs. will attempt leg deploy &amp; soft landing out to sea.
@vincent13031925 final decision made earlier this week on booster engine count. will be 33 at ~230 (half million lbs) sea-level thrust. all engines on booster are same, apart from deleting gimbal &amp; thrust vector actuators for outer 20.

@tesmanian_com yes
@teslatino @thirdrowtesla nice color
@thejmmonroe the hardest joke ever
@stephenfleming @robert_zubrin @sciguyspace something like this is the best way to do it. incent outcome, not path.
1st pure solar gigawatt hour day just achieved by @solarcity! predict 1st terawatt hour day from all us solar &lt; 15 years.
@robertgaristo v much agree. moreover, there is risk of severe non-linearities in feedback loops causing sudden warming.
drone spaceport ship heads to its hold position in the atlantic to prepare for a rocket landing

@newscientist ... say scientists  among other insights gained  after a large vat of lsd overturned in the lab. also discovered: humans are just sentient sponges, drywall tastes like a marshmallow and gravity is real. the last point remains heavily debated.
@westcoastbill indeed
@hellenomwando @markbungerlux probably closer to four or five factories. logistics costs mean you want to be close to the end customer.

@bbccomedy @boycottstuff  tracey  before i knew it, i was writing to the guardian  
@badastronomer @spacex thanks phil!
russia has excellent rocket engineering &amp; best engine currently flying. reusable version of their new angara rocket would be great.  
design completed for bringing rocket back to launchpad using only thrusters. yay. wings r just dead weight in space.
@hsueeugene @teslaownerssv @cleantechnica seems likely
@voytechnology never heard of them
@kentnstephens sure is

@nichegamer  
@maya_kazan temporary spike in some areas due to x 3rd row seat recall. should be sorted by june.
nan
@tomkiss probably mid next year before we are able to make rhd. wish it could be sooner. maybe try a model s, used or new in the meantime? used s is better than a new 3 imo, unless you want a smaller car.
by land and sea  
@tesla_truth @_tomcross_ yeah
it is hard to argue with a thermometer. global warming is real and accelerating. wish it wasn't.  
@karlschroeder interesting premise. i will read it.
long exposure shot of dragon and the space station arcing across the night sky over texas  
@jpfrappier yes, will go all the way to alaska
@falcongridfin good catch. they are there in the flight design, but we forgot to put them in this render.
yeah, this really is me, as my mom @mayemusk will attest. not sure i can handle just doing 140 char missives. will put longer thoughts on g+
great article by @badastronomer. important to note max temp record. too much attention on avg temp. max matters most  
@photofeature he was amazing
just needs some legs
@batasrki yeah, top gear pretended the tesla roadster ran out of charge and they had to push it home. logs showed 50 miles range left.
@intlmanofrealty best to study some form of engineering, which is the art of creating useful things that didn't exist before.
@bocachicagal @nasaspaceflight good chance of flying this week!
root of energy to mass ratio is max render speed of the simulation
@adultswim because honey is a vegetable
@charalanahzard those rumors are false
@ercxspace @kimpaquette interesting idea
@hankgreen @goodedesign i think the person who attacked me on twitter will survive somehow
@adamhoov yes
@lukealization no physical changes to the engine. this thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. it is just tougher than we thought.
@gerberkawasaki rare use case, but it is possible. there are complications with this. eary prototype roadsters had this ability.
@s3xy_ch sounds like this canton has style!
@tierrauniversu the writer of this article had a problem with his 12v battery, so main pack was constantly charging it.
@jubanmohamed there will be no handles
@erdayastronaut @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy more than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven
looks like falcon landed fine, but excess lateral velocity caused it to tip over post landing  
@gregmatson yes, all cars with autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of tesla cars built to date
spacex rocket factory as seen from space  
finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ...  
@tesla_bill @insideevs 2170 is about the right cell size, but i dont recommend copying our current module design. far too difficult to manufacture.
@willoremus that has been my goal from the beginning. need the gigafactory for model 3.
that was a total non sequitur btw
@rjdlandscapes @cleantechnica yes
@erdayastronaut @lord_lima_bean @uhddreamer @lanceulanoff trade is just that roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. copv in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons
not all good news. virginia dmv commissioner just denied tesla a dealer license, despite hearing officer being in favor.
an update about tesla   
regulatory approvals received, so autopilot rolling out to all countries! (excluding japan, which is still under review)
had to been done ur welcome  
@nycomwireless @teslamotors cool, thanks for buying our car!
12 story rocket turns off its engines &amp; does a controlled fall

@id_aa_carmack tks. turns out we recovered some impact video frames from drone ship. it's kinda begging to be released
@tesla_truth definitely
@teslarati @tesla_raj we can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. will post exact number soon.
@erdayastronaut @tj_cooney @lrocket @spacex @felixschlang @marcushousegame he became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. that came from me reading about soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 isp. at that isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-v than a hydrogen stage.
@loopernor yes, this will, if all goes well, be the first commercial spaceship to dock with the space station. t zero ~ end of april.
@mickyni111 look, at least its not the magellanic clouds. theyre basically next door.
reason rbc question about model 3 demand is absurd is that tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.

@geerinckx1989 yeah, but not a priority right now
@douglasbullard @teslamotors most people have never heard of nikola tesla. that will hopefully change over time.
@techreview   
@existentialcoms combined tesla+spacex market cap is now over $1.2t, which means $4.9b is less than 0.4% of combined company value

@wholemarsblog vision became so good that radar actually reduced snr, so radar was turned off.   humans drive with eyes &amp; biological neural nets, so makes sense that cameras &amp; silicon neural nets are only way to achieve generalized solution to self-driving.
@sofiaan @renatakonkoly @meckimac whats worse is that i even told stanford to check me for the $^#* parasite &amp; they still couldnt find it!
important to note that model s resale value is also higher than that of gasoline cars

glad youre enjoying model 3 &amp; thanks for buying a tesla! major enhancements to autopilot &amp; fun games coming in a month with v9.0.
just stayed at the rocket (yes!) motel near mt rushmore. sudden blizzard making road trip tricky  
@nopev biggest risk is that we take too long to solve the sustainable energy problem, causing climate change meltdown.

"going at full speed! mt @iansomerhalder: elon- you are my hero my friend.please!ramp up production on cars that use no gas."""
@lougil_ace taking action. will be a 7 day grace period for $2500 ext warranty. neg margin at that price, so must unfortunately raise.
@pmnordkvist gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. rollout of solar already begun.
@janeidyeve @renatakonkoly @mikeduncan black mirror
@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @tesla this causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes dont actually vary so much. massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.
rocket made it to drone spaceport ship, but landed hard. close, but no cigar this time. bodes well for the future tho.
thruster pods one through four are now operating nominally. preparing to raise orbit. all systems green.
@thebault_arthur still working with rdw, the car regulatory authority in netherlands. unclear why theres a delay. other countries are supportive.
@j_ump_er @neiltyson @space_station to be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. center of mass of earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at space station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of earth.

@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @yoavoffek roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!

@nickg_uk @model3owners feature coming soon
@flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @discovermag yeah, falcon heavy block 5 has way more performance than last years vehicle. lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max q without changing any parts. fh block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying.
@jeremys thanks jeremy! good seeing you in la. awesome job with yelp!
@joshuadistler now wouldn't that be interesting :)
but wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond earth-moon region. wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. internal volume ~size of suv.

@cleantechnica how many electric vehicle startups are there? seems like a lot.
new tesla red going down assembly line for the first time. we spent a lot of time on this color!  
@igorantarov @soumiksf @id_aa_carmack custom ultra high speed bus &amp; efficient cooling
@nivo0o0 was wondering what those were
@torybruno @erdayastronaut @martiandays @aerojetrdyne this is true. all that matters is number used in v equation. propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass.  
@sallyshin check  
@sulka first approximation of co2 is production cost, factoring in energy source, so model 3 obv less co2 to produce than $35k gas car by a lot
@ppathole there were no ev incentives (nor did we expect them) &amp; gasoline was super cheap, so tough to make the case for electric cars.   my guess was that we had &lt;10% chance of success &amp; most people thought 0%. the history car startups is just one big graveyard.

@guid00 yes
@crheller @spacex glad its working! the sheer amount of work done by spacex engineering, production &amp; launch teams is amazing.   ping should improve dramatically in coming months. were aiming for &lt;20ms. basically, you should be able to play competitive fps games through starlink.

@dofaquarius  
tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot  
homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to zillow. adding a powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important.

it is hard to argue with a thermometer. global warming is real and accelerating. wish it wasn't.  
juneteenth is henceforth considered a us holiday at tesla &amp; spacex
@ingvar_oolsen @neiltyson @space_station looking forward to kerbal 2!
 
@westcoastbill thanks bill!
@hipstreeet yes
sarah palin calls tesla a loser. am deeply wounded.

@michaellindahl it will be slightly smaller w fewer features as std. think audi a4 or bmw 3 vs model s being s7 or m5
falcon heavy goes vertical  
boring company just broke through the other side!!   
@elonsworld @real_futurist @lexfridman yes
@qriosity_ @mactechgenius no rare earth metals in battery
what it feels like to ride a rocket   
now at 6400 hats 
@talulahriley you're welcome. it did seem like the chicken of destiny xx
@bbcworld moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, spacex engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time.
sec, three letter acronym, middle word is elons
@dignityssb no reductions from here
easier said than done. there is a lot of pressure from investors. it is hard not to feel super bad if u don't make ur qtr.
worth noting that muller's research confirming global warming is real was funded by koch. fate loves irony.

important point highlighted by @kqed: an electric car in california produces only 1/4 co2 of gasoline  
@jamescharles that is odd. try pressing both scroll wheel buttons to reboot. have forwarded this to service.
btw, we are actually working on a charger that automatically moves out from the wall &amp; connects like a solid metal snake. for realz.

@evotorentals yes
@travelingmom23 i love canada! i'm half canadian. my mom was born in regina. my grandfather (her dad) was american, born in minnesota.
@anubhavarora06 good point
@jarkkokuoppala all
@vincent13031925 i appreciate the kind words!
going over the small nuances of model 3 production. very important that nothing sounds tinny.  
problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. tricky situation, as tesla doesnt advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among worlds biggest advertisers.
@omcintyre @crampedeyes @spacex @tesla what are you talking about? youre being incredibly rude &amp; nonsensical.
t minus 22 mins to launch mission 3 to dock with the space station

just signed giving pledge with 11 others. i hope this announcement convinces others to do the same.  
@amywestervelt @billsocalif @rmac18 @weinbergersa ive just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. its amazing that you dont understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. wow.
@angrypackomeese @dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght of course :)

@dowdedward will do. even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation.
@ppathole it does require use of a paid-time-off day, which is true of many other holidays

@omerldiri @tesla good idea. we can just have the menu pop up as soon as you put the car into park.
now back to work. intense months ahead as we ramp production of rockets and cars.
@macodiseas @oha_alex exactly
@florentderue that would be so cool!
which leads me to my next subject of gun control ... just kidding

@annerajb about 10 to 14 days
@raulv48 @bryanmacksc @tesla need to get back to spacex launch control. sorry this solution isnt perfect.
@ladykayaker @jamesworldspace so long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water wont come in
dont doubt ur vibe now on spotify  
flight computers continued transmitting for 8 seconds after reaching the water. stopped when booster went horizontal.
was just at the dmv &amp; dude had the actual sloth from zootopia on his desk  
@skorusark 400 wh/kg *with* high cycle life, produced in volume (not just a lab) is not far. probably 3 to 4 years.
looks good for a launch attempt today. upper winds slightly exceed loads in high subsonic regime, but improving.

@jimheaney absolutely. moreover, we expect to expand the facility significantly over time.
@teslatrip you're welcome :)
@disruptresearch @vincent13031925 dont know enough about georges company, but it sounds like hes focused on a machine vision approach, which is the only general solution imo

climate change explained in comic book form by xkcd   
@burkov maybe not, but its 99% dot products
@wholemarsblog not intentional! we just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire us vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in nevada, a single state. tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. we also found a way to extract lithium using nacl (table salt).
@kristennetten 
unveil happening at sunset, because that's when ...
@2552nsf yeah, that is super tricky. will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform.
@spacex my fav tweet ever
@newscientist sounds sweaty  
@browserdotsys haha true
about the nevada deal with tesla ...  
@vicentes yes
@royaljester62 @tesla yeah, will post soon
forgot to say one thing at tesla annual shareholders meeting: just as my money was the first in, it will be the last out.
@filmladd thats ridiculous, lions cant vote, they dont even have opposable thumbs. also, theyd need 61%, so no.
@ppathole i worked for peter nicholson, who is awesome. mostly, we exchanged math riddles, although i did figure out a multi-billion dollar arbitrage opportunity for the bank. figured theyd at least give me $1/hour raise, but no   
@catherineullo glass corset hand-painted in perspective in color of bone. every detail tells a story. spiked choker machined from a single piece of forged metal. crown of vantablack.

"real fraud going on is denial of climate science. as for ""subsidies"", tesla gets pennies on dollar vs coal. how about we both go to zero?"
@billym2k 
@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz many small improvements, but overall similar. wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc.
tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on earth. even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. support makes a difference. thank you.
woohoo, rocket hold down firing completed and all looks good!!
@jeffrey @neutyp matte black was surprisingly popular. probably makes sense to bring it to production.
will post video next week of designing a rocket part with hand gestures &amp; then immediately printing it in titanium
@cleantechnica confirmed
thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety
@electrekco @teslaroadtrip am feeling optimistic about beating the semi specs announced at the unveiling for the same price. the tesla semi will be something really special.
@l9cgv we should be really worried about this
as many have already noted, @chrysler is a division of fiat, an italian company. we specifically said first *us* company.
will be working at tesla on autopilot &amp; model 3 today, then aiming to pull an all-nighter and complete the master product plan

@fxzzonthebeat fatality rate also greatly overstated. because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for c19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. prevalence of coronaviruses &amp; other colds in general population is very high!

if consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. we should prob not have tax on basic foods &amp; critical meds.
@erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 you can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. that has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.

@electrekco @fredericlambert very strange. model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. if there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. may just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an ota software update.

looks like falcon landed fine, but excess lateral velocity caused it to tip over post landing  
i think if you go there, they just feed you delicious candy all day and ask nothing in return.
whats actually amazing about this accident is that a model s hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. an impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
@erdayastronaut depends on total system efficiency &amp; how long the propellant plant can run to refill starship, so 1 to 10mw as a rough guess

@tesmanian_com exactly
socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. what really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict peoples freedom.
a long way to go before most power generation is solar, but the second derivative bodes well  
regarding tesla patents  
not that this really matters. all current rocket tech, including ours, sucks. only when it becomes fully reusable, will it not suck.

@bruce_mittleman tesla cannot continue to lose money. to achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.
@mactechgenius @v_g_fischer @consumerreports braking &amp; ui upgrades apply to all model 3s. improved windshield for aero noise &amp; suspension for ride comfort are major ops. unless youre really bothered by them, dont replace. best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort.

@tobyliiiiiiiiii @erdayastronaut there will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. it will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. they were fine.

@jschindeler yeah, coming back
tesla will make fabulous short shorts in radiant red satin with gold trim
working on top secret tesla masterplan, part 2. hoping to publish later this week.
@michaelsd01 @techgrltweeter won't happen. reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
@hamiltonofiyai intentions are good, but massively overweights ch4's effect on climate.
@amasad @sra_mister yeah
@zerosixbravo slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups

and, of course, it will have more cowbells.
@ppathole starship booster, largest flying object ever designed, will be caught out of sky by launch tower. big step forward, as reflight can be done in under an hour.
falcon heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer
@oskaiper @valleyhack commercially procured launches means launches that were openly competed. spacex is not allowed to compete for many us and non-us launches.
@westcoastbill explains why there are so many cat videos
@perthguppy yeah, starlink should be active by then
@drew78823936 @erdayastronaut @djsnm @rockettenor @nasa @spacex @space_station @commercial_crew probably right. starship rate of progress far exceeds falcon &amp; dragon, although theyre critical to getting there. dinnovation/dt is what matters long-term.
@cardoso yes
@timshelton @fredericlambert @jimpengelly first in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in 6 to 9 months.

true, cost of operating a tesla is much lower than other cars
olympics opening is excellently british. jolly good show!  
@michaelemann no they don't
@grizzlyaustin @tesla no plans to introduce air suspension on model 3 at this time
@mrmeireles true, good point
@musicnick1985 @teslarati teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by spacex
@poriya_ravi @worldandscience the actual amount of time i spend on twitter is tiny. my tweets are literally what im thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda.
@jbaert yes, minifloats
if test flight of  goes well next month, @nasa   will  to @space_station this summer!
model 3 will be rwd, with dual motor awd optional. even rwd will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of tesla drivetrain.

@nextspaceflight @erdayastronaut @torybruno @martiandays @aerojetrdyne couple months, but v1.0 of raptor vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
@westcoastbill the $1400 is mostly good imo (ubi lite), as the people get to choose how the money is spent, but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole (though it is obviously characterized otherwise).

@sureal808 motor trend could only achieve 2.4 sec when they tested the porsche 918
if u saw @thesimpsons and wonder why @spacex doesn't use an electric rocket to reach orbit, it is cuz that is impossible
reality is a tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. why is this never mentioned?
even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere.

great q&amp;a @defcon last night. thanks for helping make tesla &amp; spacex more secure! planning to open-source tesla vehicle security software for free use by other car makers. extremely important to a safe self-driving future for all.
@adamklotz_ @aarons5_ @crheller @spacex more ground stations &amp; less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences.  looking at speed of light as ~300km per millisecond &amp; satellite altitude of ~550km, average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms, so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping &gt;20ms.
@thehoff525 yes. highly recommend doing so btw.

yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. that's important to minimize gravity losses.

@kerrymflynn yeah, my fault for being an idiot. we did give them a free launch to make up for it and i think they had some insurance.
@yourfavgas @archillect fine, but that was an easy one
@apexcornerspeed @braverock_ all superchargers are being converted to solar/battery power. over time, almost all will disconnect from the electricity grid.
oh yeah, well tesla will study a plan to study the gm team that's studying tesla, so there!  
looks good for a launch attempt today. upper winds slightly exceed loads in high subsonic regime, but improving.

@worldandscience for reason i can't explain, i find #2 especially odd. also, not a fan of #17. has led too many people astray in valuing securities.
anyone whos interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing  designing &amp; building the machine that makes the machine  please consider working at tesla or spacex. were gonna take this to a whole new level!

a prior track record of exceptional achievement in engineering *is* required, but *no* prior experience working on the brain or human physiology is required. we will teach you whats known about the brain, which is not much tbh.
@intlmanofrealty best to study some form of engineering, which is the art of creating useful things that didn't exist before.

@erdayastronaut @sciguyspace important technical note: due to higher o/f of ch4 vs rp1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled ch4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of ch4, tank mass of ch4/o2 stage is almost same as rp1/o2.

@erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. were simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.

@_cgp @spacex propellant was not deep cryo. ch4 &amp; o2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. in theory, raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. however, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of starship/super heavy.

@iamevilvictor its all about branding  
@morgan_murphy nice ink
@tenser one day
unlike bees, who are experts in millinery  
me &amp; other private money funded tesla for first 7 years, got ipo+ govt money for 3, now paid back. yes, carbon tax would be a better way.

@klod_ua @universal_sci some challenges with ice formation in the cryogenic propellant prevalves. hopefully overcome soon.
@djsnm @erdayastronaut @kevinkling12 @spacexcentric not currently planning for pad abort with early starships, but maybe we should. vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.

@bitcoin how much for some anime bitcoin?  
wow, a tesla owner in europe just passed 200,000 km while racing his roadster!  
and thanks very much to our suppliers &amp; logistics partners for coming through despite great difficulties!
@madera_raul yes
meant to say: prizes for first 10 who do 400 miles in tesla w/o recharging, not nonstop, which would require diapers :)
do you want tesla to accept doge?
@gigarothpack not a bad idea. for sure, it makes sense to test ai for safety in some kind of open world / sandbox virtual world.
@thesithseth @doctorow im not against all unions, but uaw has a track record of destroying productivity so a company cant compete on world market. our current factory went bankrupt under uaw before we took it over. dont want tesla to die too.
@erdayastronaut @nasaspaceflight @jeromejaccard @robotbeat @alan1bernard i will do a full technical presentation of starship after the test vehicle were building in texas flies, so hopefully march/april

starship landing nominal!
@businessinsider this part is true. i was trying to explain that we dont want our cars to have a tinny sound.  
launch and landing of the nro spy satellite was good. tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6% of the theoretical load limit.

@lanceulanoff consider an ice skater. same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. same principle is true for a car.
@seanmmvi @oloftenghoff @tesla model s &amp; x also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. we should prob tell people about this more. filters are giant, so too big to fit in model 3.
@sciguyspace yes, hardware-in-the-loop testing of software is essential
btw, foster the people is playing the model x event tonight. seemed like the right vibe.
@shortword @jwangark the socs sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of nns that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so its fairly obvious when one is discordant

@kn0xvi11ain very few. scientific consensus at time of columbus was world was round  
to be clear, tesla is in california, so it is not april fool's yet! also, some may differ, but imo the tues news is arguably more important.

@ikrivetko that's not the real steering system
@cleantechnica model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars
@erdayastronaut no, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot ch4 &amp; o2 from raptor
initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
@liketeslakim noted. we can prob adjust spring force &amp; catch to be less sensitive. cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!

@benfeldman63 thanks!
@djsnm @martijn_schuman @erdayastronaut @spacex @fcain exactly. still, pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going hypersonic speed!
@cleantechnica good analysis. both computers will be used &amp; sync ~20 times per second. this is a long time to a computer. like a twin-engine plane, use both engines to max for normal operation, but can safely operate on just one.
landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. maybe hardest impact to date. droneship still ok.
@2avsagas i guess you could say its a 150 mph, underground, autonomous, electric bus that automatically switches between tunnels and lifts. so, yes, a bus.
putting together spacex rocket landing blooper reel. we messed up a lot before it finally worked, but there's some epic explosion footage 
@verge this is crazy, but max smart mentions chaos towards the end. coincidence?

congrats to the tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
"new york judge states: ""... dealers cannot utilize the franchised dealer act as a means to sue their competitors"". exactly!"
@erdayastronaut @spacex super proud of spacex propulsion/test/materials team! one of hardest technology problems. new high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.

@djsnm pump is single string. some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines.
we tried out a new delivery system using an enclosed trailer straight from factory to owners home, so super convenient &amp; car arrives in pristine condition without wasting plastic wrap
my favorite shot from the last rocket landing attempt on the droneship

@mabzmagz boring co has advanced ground penetrating radar &amp; is pretty good at digging holes. dont know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too smal. if so, could dropship fully charged powerpacks and pumps.

@1world22gether @cyantist do you know anyone who has gone there?
@raptorweb sigh. this is crux of matter: cant make system too annoying or people wont use it, negatively affecting safety, but also cant allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.
just a reminder that the tesla full self-driving option goes up by $1000 at midnight on nov 1 for all regions that have smart summon. order your car online at

@teslarati impressively accurate analysis!

@nichegamer of course!
falcon heavy is this times three. one way or another, launch is guaranteed to be exciting ...  
@realdonaldtrump we raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. nothing more. hope this does not seem unreasonable.
a model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally.
@erdayastronaut @ivanescobosa @djsnm @kevinkling12 @spacexcentric precisely
will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to europe &amp; asia in q1. major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently.

@rjdlandscapes @tesla prices in the us (of all goods) dont include vat, but its usually included in other countries.   then theres import duty &amp; transport costs.  the intent is that revenue to tesla is roughly similar in all countries, so taxes, tariffs &amp; transport make up the difference.

@lord_lima_bean @uhddreamer @lanceulanoff exactly. total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. the composite overwrapped pressure vessel (copv) is most advanced ever made. its what spacex is qualifying for nasa crewed missions. extremely robust  literally bulletproof.

@howlpolitically @theonion 1/2 this article is false.  - i arrived by myself in canada in 89 with ~ca$2500 - paid my own way through college, ending with ~$100k student debt - started 1st company with no funding &amp; just one computer i built - theres no evidence whatsoever of an emerald mine
@dmc_ryan @anthonyfultz awd &amp; white interior in july. air suspension prob later. note, thats when we *start* making them. cant instantly fill all orders. will take 6+ months to do so.

@littlemissflint yes  no  maybe 
@teslatino @klwtts @jpr007 tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen, as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full parking lot.   just like a car parking lot, where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full.
@gerberkawasaki i thought 1999 was peak insanity, but 2021 is 1000% more insane!

@sofiaan @erdayastronaut possible, but one step at a time. anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. for example, if someones on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!

@wapodavenport however, even if it were 16 flights with docking, this is not a problem. spacex did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 &amp; has docked with station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times.

and, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. because its electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.

@okchaserthunder thats next
@lanceulanoff note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a spacex rocket copv bottle. the air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time.

@novaspivack thats certainly the right way to go to store massive amounts of data for a long time
@djsnm exactly. for reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. for ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. therefore reusable like starship wants lift during high mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.

tesla history trivia: we didnt actually come up with the tesla motors name. bought trademark off brad siewert for $75k in late 2004. hed originally filed for it in 1994. our alternative name was faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later.

worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs  
@s_padival @lopezlinette sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible youre  serving as an inside trading source for one of teslas biggest short-sellers? an ex-tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable tesla ip in exchange. is this true?
while the rocket does look rather tall &amp; tippy, a stable landing is no problem with proper throttle response

exciting to see some tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. aiming for same day soon, then under an hour.
the 2 questioners i ignored on the q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors
@davidquearney you are right
@johnpaulbrewer something on a tristate border might work. gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
my best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more ruds to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017
@tierrauniversu doesn't sound right. if it is, we certainly need to fix it. investigating...

"was misquoted by bbc as saying ""europe's rocket has no chance"". just said the [franco-german] ariane 5 has no chance, so go with ariane 6."
@erdayastronaut better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let t^4 be your friend. lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.

@erdayastronaut weve already done a lot of iteration on ship. for rapid reusability, booster must return to launchpad, so inert mass impacts ascent, boostback &amp; landing burns. triple whammy. also, booster flight rate is ~5x that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by 5.

@jimdekort @spacex it does
that was a dm, right?
@skiddlybinx about 10 orbit synch windows, which are every 26 months, so self-sufficiency around 2050

ch4 rapidly decays back to co2 &amp; is absorbed by plants. what matters is adding new carbon to surface cycle from underground oil, gas &amp; coal.
@mariom an underground hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so i think it is he right way to go

vac thrust of 700 tons means avg of 14 tons/floor of structural steel for a 50 story building.
@katheri93719178 @dtemkin yes. caves are now filled with water again. difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue.
@javagiri @tesla were opening a lot of tesla service centers next year, including knoxville. tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week.
@bob_wachter we are hearing almost all hospital icus have excess capacity. in some cases, 60% empty.

the physics of how tesla achieved best safety of any cars ever tested. note, when vehicle weight is taken into account, order is more like x,s, then 3, but they are all very close.

@jl2579 @mattyice4412 @thanr @jamesworldspace prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for scuba mouthpiece or regulator. training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack.
tesla full self-driving option cost rises by ~$1000 worldwide on july 1st. order a tesla online in less than 2 minutes at

satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. all looks good.
launch aborted: slightly high combustion chamber pressure on engine 5. will adjust limits for countdown in a few days.
@benballer thanks!
@harrystoltz1 @sofiaan @iihs_autosafety @atj721 ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident.
@whatsupfranks the number of pcr amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. from what i can gather, youre probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. sound about right?
@sciguyspace we had to reallocate some resources to speed this up &amp; received great support from airborne, our parachute supplier. i was at their irvine factory with the spacex team on sat and sun. were focusing on the advanced mk3 chute, which provides highest safety factor for astronauts.
todays falcon launch carries 2 spacex test satellites for global broadband. if successful, starlink constellation will serve least served.

@renatakonkoly @mayemusk they smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. got a replacement from junkyard. btw, great deals available from junkyards! its pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars.
@tashaark additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.   its already sensible for rocket engine parts. to the best of our knowledge, spacex is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive.
@dave_ross @tesla might arrive by june, but def before end of summer
@minliangtan @taglia thanks for offering to help. i will check with my team.
@elschumi @fredericlambert @boringcompany passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; i think theyre right. might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. so long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.

@hisdirtremoves @spacex i cant comment on turbopump internal details, but youre roughly in the ballpark. wow, rocket turbopumps, especially if oxygen-rich, are insanely hard! arguably, the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist.
@dmc_ryan @tesla it will be awesome

@heretic_soul @model3owners leasing negatively effects tesla cash flow, so we prob wont offer model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but teslas have always had strong residual value.
@adamklotz_ @erdayastronaut @spacex yes
@djsnm yes, signal acquired from that dish
yum! even better than deep fried butter:  
@teslarati hard to believe its almost time to retire cargo dragon after a decade of solid service

@rarelyserious @tesla for those unfamiliar, this uses tesla autopark/summon. slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. by next year, a tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm its valid &amp; park.

@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght the performance numbers in this database are not accurate. in process of being fixed. even if they were, a fully expendable falcon heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a delta iv heavy, is $150m, compared to over $400m for delta iv heavy.

@sciguyspace starship is making good progress
definitely harder to land on a ship. similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating.

a long way to go before most power generation is solar, but the second derivative bodes well

rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target &amp; nicely vertical! high probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather.
@canzyd high probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by dragon supersonic abort test. otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for falcon 9. starship will take over before the f9 fleet reaches end of life.

@id_aa_carmack @daniellefong actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. there are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but i recommend keeping those parts original.
cool! actually, if you buy a tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. if you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. trying to incent buying with no test drive.

@batasrki yeah, top gear pretended the tesla roadster ran out of charge and they had to push it home. logs showed 50 miles range left.
@rocketrichardp @ct_la exactly. dmv comm overruled good recommendation of hearing officer.
@seanmmvi @oloftenghoff @tesla model s &amp; x also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. we should prob tell people about this more. filters are giant, so too big to fit in model 3.
@stapf the tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for puerto rico too. such a decision would be in the hands of the pr govt, puc, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of pr.
model s receives highest customer satisfaction score of any car ever surveyed by consumer reports  
model s review by @wired. totally agree with criticisms. corrections coming soon.  
@ppathole most people have no idea starship exists or how large this beast is!  body diameter (9m or 30 ft) is bigger than a 747 or a380. starship thrust &amp; mass are more than double saturn v moon rocket.  making life multiplanetary means massive rockets. got to be done.
@samabuelsamid @teslamotors i've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the tesla history of how we got there. lot of drama  prob worth doing?

@some1gee @erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy its a factor. main reason is that ffsc is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
@flcnhvy @malcolmmarsman @marstronauts @erdayastronaut @janeidyeve @13ericralph31 @spexcast @bluemoondance74 @orion_sword @some1gee @spacex first flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. probably around 20.
@skorusark tesla &amp; ford are the only american carmakers not to have gone bankrupt out of 1000s of car startups. prototypes are easy, production is hard &amp; being cash flow positive is excruciating.
what makes this incredibly unjust is that the model s to date has the best safety record of any car on the road (no injuries or deaths ever)

@astro_elliott @lifeboathq once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry &gt;100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/mars improves with a larger rocket.   aircraft, for example, have moved away from 747/a380 to 777, which has ~100 tons of payload.

reason rbc question about model 3 demand is absurd is that tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.
@erdayastronaut stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as acs thrusters. the smaller leeward fin would simply be used as a leg.
@wingod @djsnm @thephoenixflare true, diverting a comet would be super hard. could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky.
@om cool personal essay. it really resonated with me, as i felt the same way after coming very close to dying from malaria ten years ago.
falcon heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads.

@nasaspaceflight @bbcamos over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. if starship then launched as an expendable, payload would be ~250 tons. what isnt obvious from this chart is that starship/super heavy is much denser than saturn v.

reason rbc question about model 3 demand is absurd is that tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.

@jpr007 not bad, although new model s has more range &amp; faster charging. 3 &amp; y should use long range version, as performance version is meant for max speed &amp; handling, not max range.   supercharger network is being upgraded to 250kw to 300kw, so that will help too.

@dmc_ryan yes, v10 will include several games &amp; infotainment features, improved highway autopilot, better traffic light &amp; stop sign recognition &amp; smart summon
@brianmrtz probably unwise
@rickandmorty the singularity for this level of the simulation is coming soon. i wonder what the levels above us look like.   good chance they are less interesting and deeper levels are better. so far, even our primitive sims are often more entertaining than reality itself.

@tlowdon @ethicalskeptic antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. in a study that spacex did working with harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low &amp; symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory t cells

it naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. for example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler.

@erdayastronaut @bocachicagal @nasaspaceflight dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. with more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight.
@teslamotorsclub lot of respect for ntsb, but nhtsa regulates cars, not ntsb, which is an advisory body. tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. to do otherwise would be unsafe.

@ercxspace @smvllstvrs t/w will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. high t/w is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. for expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low t/w.

@scottwww @tesla gap in understanding is that $35k model 3 production *starts* this month, but will not reach volume production until mid year. extremely difficult to predict middle part of manufacturing s-curve.
@theseanbooker sir, this will not be some a dainty little buttercup of a truck! drivers seat will be big enough to fit andr the giant (love that guy).
@jefftutorials @tonytesla4life @wholemarsblog yes
@grahamablair of course :)
good primer on the exponential advancement of technology, particularly ai  
@ppathole @tesla reducing traffic fatalities by 90% seems likely, perhaps ultimately by over 99%
@marcushousegame @neopork85 @spacex @erdayastronaut @spacetoday1 @elonsworld @felixschlang @chrisg_nsf @djsnm yes. this is the hardest part of the booster design.
@fredericlambert a loop is like a hyperloop, but without drawing a vacuum inside the tube. dont need to get rid of air friction for short routes.
@johnnasabri @dtemkin it sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. i suppose that is what religion tells us. wonder what i should do differently.
@ivanmartinsanz good one
@hohocho @tesla should be coming back online now. looks like we may have accidentally increased verbosity of network traffic.  apologies, we will take measures to ensure this doesnt happen again.

@electrekco i have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. it is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. customer happiness &amp; safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.
all systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. standing down to investigate.

tesla keeps temp below 40c/105f by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on ac when needed. can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
@connectdotstoo sure
however, when self-driving cars become safer than human-driven cars, the public may outlaw the latter. hopefully not.
will communicate better in the future. too many people want us to fail and are willing to twist any bit of news against tesla.

$300m cost diff between spacex and boeing/lockheed exceeds avg value of satellite, so flying with spacex means satellite is basically free

@flcnhvy @djsnm neuralink this month &amp; tesla next month, spacex probably october. we will have made a lot of progress by then. might have a prototype booster hop done by then.
restart was good, apogee raised to 80k km (50k miles). yes!!!

@xdreamcoding @frank_thelen nice branding
@lanceulanoff yes, when it comes to physics, make sure newton is on your side
rocket fairing falling from space (higher res)  
@smartereveryday @badastronomer we already do targeted retro burn to a specific point in pacific w no islands or ships, so upper stage doesnt become a dead satellite. need to retarget closer to shore &amp; position catcher ship like mr steven.
particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. may come from rocket or something else.
not all good news. virginia dmv commissioner just denied tesla a dealer license, despite hearing officer being in favor.
@erdayastronaut @ppathole @austinbarnard45 @labpadre if you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, youre doomed anyway, so might as well go all in
abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. adjusting thresholds and restarting count at t-10 mins.
@thebradholt we need a compelling video that convinces tx lawmakers to pass the direct sales law just approved by their committee.
@cryptowhale sclerotic democracy
tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is model s, model x, then mass market third gen vehicle &amp; truck
@mwangltg yes
@thirdrowtesla yes, this is insane
tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot  
nan
to provide a little perspective on the size of grasshopper, we added a 6 ft cowboy to the rocket  
@wholemarsblog  
@inzilya777 @archillect  albedo will drop significantly on almost every successive launch
nan
@mactechgenius @model3owners definitely
@darkaraus_ @zanfa no, payload will actually increase
@game_overlord98 yeah
@jack_p that said, i do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). a nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. i have given vastly more to humanitarian causes.
imma gonna dig that tunnel with this here hammer
@erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @spacex yeah, will take less than a minute to order on  
@jroque250 @freewill404 @cbotnyse a tiny one
while the rocket does look rather tall &amp; tippy, a stable landing is no problem with proper throttle response

improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term challenges. not sales constrained.
@teslacharts then youll be fine

@renatakonkoly @moskov yeah, spacex is working on ventilators too
@bryanclarke physics + a broad range of engineering. worth taking humanities courses too, particularly history.
@elonmusk sorry, meant to say edt.
@ppathole summarizes pretty much every biz school case study
@erdayastronaut @nasa @boeingspace for sure!
@beardyman this is definitely worth thoughtful debate. what might we do differently to improve human/life happiness?
@pcwizardllc no major precipitating event, but people in general were going a bit too fast on winding roads
loss of falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. originated around upper stage oxygen tank. cause still unknown. more soon.
you're most welcome. very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since dc to ac.

@johnnasabri @dtemkin it sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. i suppose that is what religion tells us. wonder what i should do differently.
1st firing of falcon 9-r advanced prototype rocket. over 1m lbs thrust, enough to lift skyscraper

falcon 9 launch window is sunday and monday, assuming good weather at vandenberg air force base
@officialjaden yes. will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. when safety looks good after 10m miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm.
nan

@erdayastronaut @discovermag massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. best choice for the impatient. ion engines are too slow.
@s_padival @lopezlinette sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible youre  serving as an inside trading source for one of teslas biggest short-sellers? an ex-tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable tesla ip in exchange. is this true?
@joshgans we went through the same drama on s &amp; x and almost all confirmed in the end. will likely be even better for model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. i worry zero about demand. just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom.
@priyancaford i wish. it's so annoying.

of course i still love you  
@djslimeball busted 
@tjmurphy_mit @thesheetztweetz @exploremars @spacex @theespacedude the outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no tvc actuators. steering control comes from center 8 tvc &amp; differential throttle of outer engines. by any measure, the high thrust variant of raptor will probably have the high t/w of any engine ever.

@harrystoltz1 @28delayslater @tesla a little, but this is mostly a design update for those interested
@_elombardo @rjpryan correct
@rosssheingold @tesla all model 3s ever made can upgrade
world violence being super low is probably counter-intuitive to most people. that's because modern media is a misery microscope.
@plot_qasc its only slightly more expensive to tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing
model s review by motor trend  
@trevormahlmann @arstechnica v1.1 legs will be ~60% longer. v2.0 legs will be much wider &amp; taller  like falcon, but capable of landing on unimproved surfaces &amp; auto-leveling.
@paul49787221 @mooroobee @itsallrisky @sensanders exactly
@heydave7 yes
@lytovchenkoserg @john_gardi @erdayastronaut rocket booster temperatures wont go much above 600 kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200k on base, which uncooled steel can handle. starship is around 1700k for a mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.
tesla is also extending the model s warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident
credit for solarcity is really due to rive bros &amp; great team there. my contribution is fairly small.

a model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally.
also, lease price improvement is due to us bank deal. it is *not* a discount. revenue to tesla is unchanged.

@rainmaker1973 tesla autopilot spends a lot of effort on minimizing jerk
@martiandays @erdayastronaut @torybruno @aerojetrdyne we def could be wrong about this, but its actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. dont need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.
@erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.

@tsrandall incorrect. pana cell lines at giga are only at ~24gwh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on model 3 output since july. no choice but to use other suppliers for powerwall/powerpack cells. tesla wont spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35gwh theoretical.

@addankisarat you can tweet to tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards
@knightmararchon @evbite @johnrobb very much so. there are 2.5b cars &amp; trucks on earth. even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25m vehicles per year. tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but thats a mere 2% of 25m or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply.

wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to tesla owners ww for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail.   so much blood, sweat &amp; tears from the tesla team went into creating cars that youd truly love. i hope you do.  how can we improve further?
@flcnhvy for sure 
also, lease price improvement is due to us bank deal. it is *not* a discount. revenue to tesla is unchanged.

max acceleration was 6x gravity, altitude 1187m, lateral distance 1202m and velocity 155 m/s. main chutes deployed 970m.
@erdayastronaut @blamblas @latimes @spacex @blueorigin exactly. mars propellant production will combine atmospheric co2 &amp; water (ice) to make ch4 (methane) &amp; o2. will do same on earth long-term. short-term, each falcon flight uses roughly same fuel mass as a 747 flight. falcon is ~71% oxygen &amp; starship is ~78%, so mostly not fuel.
@mrgreyev @dirtytesla @tesla when we need strange training examples, eg half a car on highway, tesla sim delivers.   also, accidents on autopilot are becoming rarer, so we need more close call examples.  for safety tests, autopilot sees dummy far away. emergency braking only needed for distracted drivers.
@yashwanthnadal im told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. this would make our cars unaffordable.

@sciguyspace cumulative payload to orbit is the really crazy number. falcon has delivered more than double rest of world combined over trailing 12 months.

@existentialcoms that article was pushed as propaganda to counter imf study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. even if $4.9b was true, combined market cap of tesla &amp; spacex is $80b. where did the other $75b come from? ass

@spacexupdates @erdayastronaut high payload/delta-v missions will always be far downrange. value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. altitude is almost unimportant.
btw, high accel only needed because tube is short. for passenger transport, this can be spread over 20+ miles, so no spilt drinks.

@martinengwicht @iamacloudguy @model3owners probably v10 alpha build
@discovermag sharknado is real
@flcnhvy pitch control requires more force than yaw &amp; much more force than roll. also, grid fins closer to or in the wake of the booster are less effective.   however, pretty good aero control can technically be achieved with only 2 grid fins, with some effect on accuracy.
@olivierw4 longitudinal control will, but lateral (steering) control will cap at 35 mph for a bit longer. will raise after full fleet data rolls in.
@cleantechnica cool
@copticchad @erdayastronaut @privater @marc_benton @teslatunity @model3owners @tesla net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running, as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold (&amp; rejects motor heat to air when outside is warm)

@ufrugger10 i agree. will be restored shortly.
thoughtful analysis of the tesla/solarcity merger by @tsrandall  
perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in la for ~$10m with v1 (godot). next tunnel will be made with v2 (line-storm). v3 (prufrock), aspirationally 10x better, should be operational next year. for reference:  
@vicentes obviously wrong
@ppathole yes
@mrkylefield @cleantechnica exactly, fuel cells = fool sells
good analysis. you can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use apple pay at  
@justpaulinelol @evafoxu @spacex august 24th, either at cape canaveral or boca chica
@ppathole @teslarati @teslaroadtrip were still far from simply video in, control out. the biggest game-changer, currently underway at tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference.
great discussion about solar/batteries empowering rural communities

@icannot_enough @simriyat @gawwy @aperezposada @reuters @sal19 strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? are your viewers informed about an analysts track record before hearing their opinion.
lovely story  
@rationaletienne @evafoxu @amargosavalley that might have something to do with it. stalin: court of the red tsar was one of the few books so dark i had to stop reading. if only theyd listened to lenins last wish, much tragedy may have been averted.
@nasaspaceflight unlike its aircraft division, which is fine, the faa space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure.   their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities. under those rules, humanity will never get to mars.
@tesmanian_com even if half that amount, its still a big deal!
still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly

@fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey spacex merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg ssme or rd), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. raptor has better isp, but im worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.

@jacksmacintosh @smilesimplify @j_brorsson @electrekco @fredericlambert the fsd upgrade is the tesla computer with our nn chip
fire and ice  
@scottmcnealy that article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. wager right now that sun has received far more than tesla?
launch postponed due to lightning from an approaching anvil cloud
and, yes, i do in fact know that this sounds crazy. that is not lost on me. nor i do think spacex will do this alone.

@tossha_spb @atlasobscura will do starship presentation a few weeks after hopper hovers, so prob late july. if that timing works, free lj chips for all present!
@renatakonkoly @erdayastronaut @spacex its also because of the spitfire engine &amp; wizard

@silverblue16 (sigh) i do like ty, but shes a friend. we are not dating.
@martx1995 @leighalexander true
@mthorpxxi we are working on enlarging the opening. aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
yeah, i lift a little   
a beautiful and awe-inspiring view of earth from the international space station  
@teslagong @torybruno at least a few years before starlink revenue is reasonably predictable. going public sooner than that would be very painful. will do my best to give long-term tesla shareholders preference.
@petehague @ceciliakang exactly. and nyt could have anyone post an op ed. why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this non-journalist who is also pro gasoline cars? is this just published as counterpoint? i assume nyt does believe in climate change?
the tesla truck will have dual motor all-wheel drive w crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. those will be standard.

falcon heavy remains go for launch at 1:30pm on tuesday
@fredericlambert electric pods for sure. rails maybe, maybe not.
super appreciate free concert for tesla during this intense time! 
@erdayastronaut got a little melty tbh :)
meant to post this link for merlin:

the president just called to say congrats. caller id was blocked, so at first i thought it was a telemarketer :)
video review of model s vs. aston martin rapide s by @autocar  
@grimmerkimmer @dpinsen given the extreme burn, shorts are pushing every possible fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt story  
@blkmdl3 @wholemarsblog literally!
ca's death valley is #1 again! tesla hot weather testing was done there. model s was fine but gas tow truck overheated.

@teslaownerssv @flcnhvy no, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. thats the sales pitch. want to go?
@lorengrush @verge its true tho
ascent phase good. dragon deployed to space station rendezvous orbit.
abort was caused by oxygen in ground side tea-teb. upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.
@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght the performance numbers in this database are not accurate. in process of being fixed. even if they were, a fully expendable falcon heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a delta iv heavy, is $150m, compared to over $400m for delta iv heavy.
@7400n @model3owners ok
@stryker_88 that doesn't make sense. will look into it.
@newscientist i think ive paid for a subscription at least three times, but your paywall keeps forgetting this
@chrisbrandow @tea_in_space yup or douglas aircraft, creator of the awesome dc-3  
wikception  
launch was good. all satellites deployed at the targeted orbit insertion vectors.  
not that this really matters. all current rocket tech, including ours, sucks. only when it becomes fully reusable, will it not suck.
this is real btw
@skiesforme @teslamotors that said, the white interior is the best. highly recommend.

@disinformatico @eddy_jahn tesla tesla autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert.
@ppathole i mostly run alpha software in my car, which is not meant for public consumption. a few days before release, i switch my car to what public will experience.
yes. supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of europe next year. from ireland to kiev, from norway to turkey.
about 2 mins from static fire
@fredericlambert @georgezachary i had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering &amp; manufacturing problems at tesla (especially) &amp; spacex
@dragtimes yes, but held up by autopilot . it def works tho in shaving 0.1 sec off 0-60mph &amp; 1/4 mile. if ap goes tmrw, then perf upgrade goes thurs.

@dmc_ryan going through final validation &amp; regulatory approval. probably releases to early access program owners in a few weeks. its trippy!
the rumor that im secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false
@ca_via_greenbay always look on the bright side of life 
@c3lt_games will be answered on 28th
@benoitdenayer @navincho @katlinegrey essentially, yes. great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on mars.
please take a moment to report accounts clearly engaged in harassment. it is the only way to maintain public discourse.
@danmoran3 @redletterdave exactly. there is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. it's just a non-zero possibility. don't know more.

@teslaforlife @teslaownerssv @kristennetten @model3owners exactly! weve only one car factory in california &amp; one gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in nevada. giga shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater china area. over time, regional gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.

@h3_extrachars you can upload custom music/sounds
@rdstrick777 @erdayastronaut @stevenhardison @lrocket no, just preparing for untethered hover tests
@scottwww @jessicahuseman it is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. we are not perfect, but were doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company.
@teslaownerssv @kristennetten sure
will still transport cars, but only after all personalized mass transit needs are met. its a matter of courtesy &amp; fairness. if someone cant afford a car, they should go first.
@kimitalvitie yes, v close! nice work. those are v0.9 legs, so major upgrades coming. need wider span, longer stroke &amp; ability to auto-level for uneven ground or leaning into high winds.
thats the name of my new intergalactic media empire, exclamation point optional
@talktesla @techmeme @timkhiggins according to nhtsa, there was an automotive fatality every 86m miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). tesla was every 320m miles. its not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a tesla. we will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.

@annerajb about 10 to 14 days
perhaps that one was too edgy 
@thomas_tregner exactly!
@realdonaldtrump also, no us auto company is allowed to own even 50% of their own factory in china, but there are five 100% china-owned ev auto companies in the us

@siwgrindaker @erikveen should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. if oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.
what makes this incredibly unjust is that the model s to date has the best safety record of any car on the road (no injuries or deaths ever)
 
@evafoxu @spacex that was our last chance to reach orbit. if it had failed, spacex would have died.
should mention that the tesla solar roof is robust against any weather, incl heavy hail. also, higher insulating value than a standard roof.
@nasaspaceflight  
@dmc_ryan spooling up production line rapidly. hoping to manufacture ~1000 solar roofs/week by end of this year.
@erdayastronaut i talked about falcon 9 &amp; heavy for over a decade!
just had texas bbq for lunch in capitol building. about to head to house committee hearing to advocate for tesla in tx.
@richardmatthias her later years are debatable, but her early years are not imo. britain went from dreary to great again.
what would you love to see in a tesla pickup truck? i have a few things in mind, but what do you think are small, but important nuances &amp; what would be seriously next level?
we figured out how to design rocket parts just w hand movements through the air (seriously). now need a high frame rate holograph generator.
good summary of my talk in paris on climate change  
set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in model 3 for best air quality. air filters are smaller than s/x, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times.
@cthorm ss heart of gold powered by the infinite improbability drive!
check out model s at tesla austin gallery at the domain opening today! i will stop by this eve and tomorrow morning.
@ppathole i do
@samtalkstesla maybe we used too many magenta spotlights
tried to buy  
@sahilmalik that's how the tiles sit on the roof. there is no difference in strength for the tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).
