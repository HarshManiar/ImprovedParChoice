@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others, but yes. that's the value of having a pica-3 heat shield with propulsive landing.

@dean_arexding there will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
@spexcast @robotbeat @john_gardi @spacex very dependent on volume, but im confident moving to mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on earth &amp; move to mars if they want.

@jeffnesbit @tesla tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. many fit this description, but consumer reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism.
@sciguyspace raptor uses dual redundant torch igniters. better long-term, but more finicky in development.
@tesla whether you plan to buy a dual motor performance model 3 or not, take it for a test drive anyway. its like having pure fun jacked straight into your brain whenever you want.
@simplydonya yes, but arguably that's worse

initial hat offering going great w over $300k in hat sales already! thanks for buying our super boring hat. you rock, figuratively &amp; literally. all cash goes directly towards more boring.
@nichegamer @keego73 tasty food!
@darksapiens easier to make the plane change to equatorial orbit. done in order to reduce satellite side delta v from 1800 m/s to 1500 m/s.
good summary of rocket landing history. there were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long.  
@neopork85 @spacex @nasaspaceflight @austinbarnard45 @whoisheartbreak @erdayastronaut @felixschlang @marcushousegame @spacetoday1 more great renderings! significant improvements coming to the welds.
tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. one is optimized for power &amp; one for range. car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; dont get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
@model3owners dry electrode is a key piece (one of many pieces) of the puzzle for lowering cost of lithium batteries.   that said, it has required an *immense* amount of engineering to take maxwells proof-of-concept to high-quality, volume production &amp; were still not quite done.
@bad_at_life @wholemarsblog diess is doing his best to move in the right direction, but hes in a tough position with so many constituencies to please. no way to make everyone happy.

@teslaownerssv youre welcome!  if any of this is based on hertz, id like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet.  tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to hertz for the same margin as to consumers.  hertz deal has zero effect on our economics.

@skorusark cars today are far more complex than model t, with a global supply chain that is vulnerable to force majeure risk.   like model t, supply chain for battery evs simply doesnt exist at massive scale, so must be built in parallel.  ideas are easy, production is hard.

@rationaletienne @f9block5 while perhaps obvious in hindsight, it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world ai. that is what tesla is doing, both in hardware &amp; software.  unless a company is good at ai with tight compute, its hopeless. this is insanely hard.
@amitkatwala @wireduk mostly accurate, even though i didnt do an interview (or pose for cover)

higher safety &amp; environmental requirements &amp; labor costs explain only a small part of the difference. true root cause imo is an exponential growth in bureaucracy &amp; a self-serving private sector consultant industry earning a % on project cost, incenting them to maximize cost.
there are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example california offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, colorado $4000, etc

@youri_hart major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out.
@rationaletienne i am  openly moderate
@lazarusrang humanity is not perfect, but its all weve got
@robotbeat @doctorow i am too, of sorts. govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.
@kenlacovara agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (ch4 particularly)
games only render what you look at when you look at it, as the compute load would otherwise be impossibly high. until observed, objects are a probability function, aka quantum mechanics.  
@bentobewild yes, we will unveil a fully functional advanced prototype of the model x -- almost identical to production.
@elliemecham @whatsinside haha 
@4thfromourstar already have one
@rationaletienne @shycybertruck fate loves irony, but hates hypocrisy
exactly. better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. let market decide.
@seanchin @raimisj over the air upgrade coming in a few months to allow tethering (and other things).
now that hopper has flown, starship update probably in two weeks or so.
base is 300 ft by 100 ft, with wings that extend width to 170 ft. will allow refuel &amp; rocket flyback in future.

it naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. for example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler.
first draft animation of the falcon heavy three core launch. fh is twice the thrust of the next  
@aarons5_ @teslatino over time, all countries
mounting landing legs (~60 ft span) to falcon 9 for next month's space station servicing flight  
@djenkins6 using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in copv, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. but we are going to go a lot further.
appreciate thoughtful @sulliview article. faith in @nytimes restored.

@annerajb @farismahdawi @nasa @space_station sure. also, we need to be better at remembering brightness settings.
@fredericlambert good idea
@cptncrutch5373 @erdayastronaut @kalzsom approximately correct. we also fire the acs thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.

@fredericlambert @georgezachary also, tesla was competing for some of same people as openai &amp; i didnt agree with some of what openai team wanted to do. add that all up &amp; it was just better to part ways on good terms.
@kristennetten great idea!
@newscientist ... say scientists  among other insights gained  after a large vat of lsd overturned in the lab. also discovered: humans are just sentient sponges, drywall tastes like a marshmallow and gravity is real. the last point remains heavily debated.
@mattremp yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. less concrete, more trees.
@mr_computique if any formula instantiates reality, its probably that

good description of the launch by @wired:  
@28delayslater missed you too 
completed rocket static fire with all systems green this time. launch window opens in 10 days  
@johnny0129 we are still closing stores, just not as many as before. this basically splits the difference  about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. was discussed with exec team &amp; board.
@lindowitz @fredericlambert its a reasonable criticism. we wanted to make the awesome version of model 3 performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. taking corrective action 
nan
over 325k cars or ~$14b in preorders in first week. only 5% ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation.

big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). much better to emphasize the latter.
prob good though. will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter (not needed for launch, but nice to have).

@dylanneumann2 @everman exactly. gasoline cars will be like steam engines  quaint, but not something youd actually use to get around. btw, i like steam engines &amp; trains in general.

gigafactory in units of hamster  
@vincent13031925 @teslarati @panasonic to clarify further, the long-term goal for tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). this is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.
@ayshardzn given chiang rai airport hours, soonest we couldve departed us was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. will continue testing in la in case needed later or for somewhere else in future.
great explanation of the @teslamotors announcement by @techcrunch  
am not saying that is *necessarily* good or bad, but reality will force us to live with the consequences of our actions  
@chiefpad @jamesworldspace so long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. this is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10x to 1000x more power.

closeup of the titanium grid fins. not painted, as they glow red hot during a fast reentry.  
@andrewhaigh yeah, car should auto play when it gets an exact match, like it does for directions. will make that change.

@boringcompany nice work!
@mliebow @tesla much appreciated! great word-of-mouth is why model 3 is the best-selling electric car, despite no advertising or paid endorsements.
@darma_setia more likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of hell. clarkson doesn't understand technology.
model s review by motor trend  
@danielbrennan yes, about 0.5% of what i donated to @sierraclub, which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue
high altitude wind shear data shows a probable 2% load exceedance. small, but better to be paranoid. postponing launch to tomorrow, assuming winds are better then.
@erdayastronaut @i_gvf @sciguyspace exactly. chartering a dedicated 747 flight around the world costs less than buying a small, single engine turboprop plane. in the same way, a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once.
@canis_majoris_6 @yusifzadaagshin ~1000, as all seats would be coach &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. its basically an icbm traveling at mach 25 that lands.

@renatakonkoly @wr4nygov exactly
@erdayastronaut @torybruno @martiandays @aerojetrdyne oberth effect is not well appreciated. value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. one of the reasons we favor ch4 over h2.  
@teslatested so many reporters gave chanos airtime when he called tesla a worthless fraud. now that he has been proven wrong, silence 
@scottymeuk @scaleymurrsuit no, its got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original roadster. still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered.

@cleantechnica no, but you make some great points. important to note that irons cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass, so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel. that said, iron alleviates much of the scaling problem.

@fredericlambert a loop is like a hyperloop, but without drawing a vacuum inside the tube. dont need to get rid of air friction for short routes.
@quietlybear do all the intro courses for mech, ee, aero and physics, then specialize in the one you like most.
@mactechgenius @v_g_fischer @consumerreports braking &amp; ui upgrades apply to all model 3s. improved windshield for aero noise &amp; suspension for ride comfort are major ops. unless youre really bothered by them, dont replace. best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort.

"@marthajross @mercnews wasn't wearing a suit, am def not part of a ""posse"" &amp; didn't even know leo/orlando were going. just went to say hi to my friend ken howery."
anyone who purchased full self-driving will get fsd computer upgrade for free. this is the only change between autopilot hw2.5 &amp; hw3. going forward hw3 will just be called fsd computer, which is accurate. no change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. this is v important.
@kerbalspacep what are we doing wrong at spacex? you probably have some good ideas.   the fundamental optimization for making life multiplanetary &amp; backing up the biosphere is cost per ton to the surface of mars.   what system achieves that best?

@m40dotcom @justinandgreg many cold weather improvements coming via ota software
@grafikhure_de @stevenhardison skin will get too hot for paint. stainless mirror finish. maximum relfectivity.
@elonmusk max performance numbers are for expendable launches. subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
@ivanescobosa @gerberkawasaki yes
cowboy riding the rocket no problemo  
falcon 9 flight 11 to geosynchronous transfer orbit completed on target this morning  
@owillis you should ask why i would want money. the reason is not what you think. very little time for recreation. dont have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.
@tesmanian_com demand is no problem, but near-term cell supply makes it hard to scale semi. this limitation will be less onerous next year.
@ticeestes am not trying to accumulate cool points. she was far from perfect, but her actions, on balance, were good.
walked around a neighborhood recently rebuilt with help from apj and others  
been wanting to go ever since that finnish metal band won  
tesla owners can grant free supercharging for life to a friend who buys s/3/x. ends tomorrow night.  
@marinasblinova @mikejudge @recode that would definitely help
@business teslas action is not directly reflective of my opinion. having some bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an s&amp;p500 company.
@n23mc i think we will see people on mars in less than 20 years. 12 to 15 years most likely. #occupymars
@teslaownerssv @teslarati not sure. maybe write or message carmakers who oppose the environmental initiative?
@gerberkawasaki wow, i super loved astronomy (but took it at queens, not penn)! definitely one of my favorite classes. senior year quantum mechanics at penn was the hardest class i ever took. that stuff will mess with your mind.
upcoming falcon 9 demo has a lot of new technology, so the probability of failure is significant

@deepbluecea @ruboyad yes
@nichegamer @tomekdrabas @merkinvineyards merkindise coming soon!
@jennerator211 yeah. maybe following individual journalists &amp; citizen journalists is better than publications. the onion may be the best mainstream media source. hard to figure out whats actually going on in the world!

@mikekasprzik @tesla try connecting to wifi
@erlendmoberget @ramez @khayhoe very true. whats really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs &amp; how little of it is absorbed by earth. there is sooo much solar energy. we can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of earths surface, which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun.

@gdoehne @disinformatico @eddy_jahn the google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
@vinnylingham unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. wish there was an easy way.
@teslarati great work by spacex parachute engineering! the crew dragon parachutes are way more difficult than they may seem. the apollo program found them to be so hard that it became a notable morale problem!

@trakz @thesimpsons of course!
@skorusark pretty much. we place high value on simulation too, but nothings as weird as reality!

@lexfridman the aliens would say so long, and thanks for the orifice!
@teslaownerssv well aim to have it come out same time as truck. two seater electric atv designed to work with cybertruck will be fun! electric dirt bikes would be cool too. we wont do road bikes, as too dangerous. i was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when i was 17.
well  it looked smaller on paper
my first prediction of 2012 has come true: ouch, my head hurts.

@gamingspeedy were working on it. takes time to get all regulatory approvals. almost there for the larger us states. at least 6 to 12 months for europe/uk.
@carpenter_maas as the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. there is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic.

@bryson_m @rmac18 @serdarsprofile @brianacton definitely. looks lame anyway.
@teslatested probably
to be clear, tesla is in california, so it is not april fool's yet! also, some may differ, but imo the tues news is arguably more important.

@markpinc @teslamotors thanks!
@erdayastronaut @nasaspaceflight there were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level.   something similar happened on an early falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.

@dmc_ryan @jason theres a tough performance vs range tradeoff. plaid has absurd performance, while holding range roughly constant.
@joe_mckirdy @13ericralph31 @jhc2718 @stephanieeeeej 100mt to 125mt for true useful load to useful orbit (eg starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mt for reference payload compared to other rockets. this is in fully reusable config. about double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never.
this piece about mars in the nyt is worth a read  
@goombar3 weve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; tesla stock. also, free drinks &amp; snacks. try to make it fun too. top ten hourly workers cumulatively received tesla stock now worth $1m to $2m. nobody wants uaw, so uaw keeps trashing tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties.
@crackedupcorson will cover whole country hopefully this year
@13ericralph31 @ppathole @erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @spacexnow @chrisg_nsf @nasaspaceflight yeah, *way* better. dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly mach 20.
@noahshachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba hello, have you met the internet? everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. saying im against science is like saying beyonc doesnt know beats. blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like socratic dialogue.
@worldout_42 @billsocalif @fnord3125 exactly
@c_bass3d @erdayastronaut sn8
@flcnhvy starship steel decision came first. we were going to use titanium skins for cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30x stainless is much stronger.
f9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71m lbf later this year. it is capable of 1.9m lbf in flight.
@megangale @tesla sorry, weve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. were making rapid progress. should be solved shortly.

just wanted to say thanks to everyone for testifying yesterday in austin. will hang around after press conf to thank people in person.
@tesla_raj lot of people dont realize that you can watch almost any show in a tesla
@erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.
@talulahriley good suggestion :)
starlink mission will be heaviest @spacex payload ever at 18.5 tons. if all goes well, each launch of 60 satellites will generate more power than space station &amp; deliver 1 terabit of bandwidth to earth.
@evhq2 @tashaark it should be
@tzepr certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. the cheering is in good spirit.
@boringcompany youre all hired!
@williamricci6 50% higher. ~1.3 m lbs sea level and ~1.5 m lbs vacuum thrust. will be 60% higher with some tweaks.

@jonnajarian yes, improvement is exponential
tesla is sometimes criticized for government support, but all us car companies (plus some non) got loans and only tesla has paid its back  
@nomanssky you're welcome. good conversation.
went to iceland on sat to ride bumper cars on ice!  no, not the country, vlad's rink in van nuys. awesome family fun :)  
@erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @harrystoltz1 @flcnhvy since raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. however, raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.
wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a tesla. it matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. we won't forget.

@spexcast @robotbeat @john_gardi @spacex very dependent on volume, but im confident moving to mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on earth &amp; move to mars if they want.

@spexcast @trungtphan starship will be crushingly cost-effective for earth orbit or moon missions as soon as its operational &amp; rapid reuse is happening.   mars is a lot harder, because earth &amp; mars only align every 26 months, so ship reuse is limited to ~dozen times over 25 to 30 year life of ship.

abort was caused by oxygen in ground side tea-teb. upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.

compared to past, today's world is fantastic &amp; likely will be for many decades. just need to cover future downside risk.

@timsweeneyepic thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at present, hence hard touchdown. weve never seen this before.  next time, min two engines all the way to the ground &amp; restart engine 3 if engine 1 or 2 have issues.
making large scale rocket propulsion landing work well is a critical step towards a fully reusable mars transport system
@seangvarney that is true &amp; should be applauded. right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.
@univercurious black-scholes formula is kinda bs. big difference between a finance approximation &amp; fundamental physics / pure math.
@thejackbeyer @marcushouse @artzius center engines on ship will be same as booster engines. this is basically raptor 2.  raptor vacuum would be only variant. tbd as to whether to commonize r-vac with raptor 2 (more thrust), keep same or tighten throat (more isp).   adding 3 more r-vac to ship with max isp maybe
