@erdayastronaut @tesla absolutely
@uncover007 500 ft so far. should be 2 miles long in three or four months and hopefully stretch the whole 405 n-s corridor from lax to the 101 in a year or so.
f9r (pronounced f-niner) shows a little leg. design is a nested, telescoping piston w a frame.  
@erdayastronaut @spacex absolutely, but to move to mk3 design. this had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different.

thank you, south texas for your support! this is the gateway to mars.
@vicentes cute!
@bizbuilderusa @mcannonbrookes it's been a bear to get done, but prob 10 days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results

@curiousworlds for sure. first set of tunnels are to alleviate greater la urban congestion. will start ny-dc in parallel. then prob la-sf and a tx loop.
@teslarati good summary
@mkbhd @hyperchangetv the dry questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their tesla short thesis. they are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. hyperchange represented actual investors, so i switched to them.
@daferna2 @andrewyang probably something notable to announce in a few months
@skiddlybinx yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained.  yes, but were going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads.
@ford could be slightly faster
@kateconger will be hanging with my little chum, gary, on sunday

@erdayastronaut @marekcyzio @katlinegrey actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for launch capability. even if they do zero launches, us govt still gives them that.

@skorusark marginal cost of starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
@thenosyt definitely. you will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. software team is focused on core model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features.
@kimchee_chigae @spacex thanks :) such an outrageous lawsuit. people sometimes underestimate strength of us judiciary. lot of respect for the judge &amp; jury system.

@mcannonbrookes $250/kwh at the pack level for 100mwh+ systems. tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
the same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering, as one use obviates the other
evolution hasn't advanced much  
the exec conf room at tesla used to be called denali, but i decided to move a few letters around. seemed more apt :)  
weve been so mired in production &amp; logistics for past 18 months. really looking fwd to getting semi into production.

@cleantechnica so crazy to subsidize pollution! this is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another cars exhaust pipe.

@kimbal there are a lot of c19 false positives messing up the numbers. even tests with 5% false positive rate (in *field*, not lab) would show up as ~17 million  fake c19 cases even if there were actually none.

model 3 mid-range epa rating is actually 264 miles, slightly higher than prior estimate of 260  
@gfilche also, we need to figure out how to render voxel height of unknown objects in a way that isnt horrendous
@everydayelon @teslatested @teslaownerssv @kimbal hcl appears to be effective when used early  
my favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
@erdayastronaut @torybruno @martiandays @aerojetrdyne max thrust version of raptor should achieve true t/w &gt; 170. target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-f. max isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but t/w probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. these are just guesses for now.

sooo annoying!!  
dragon spaceship and falcon 9 rocket just completed final assembly at cape canaveral  
@tj_cooney that said, most starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on earth

@chiefpad @jamesworldspace so long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. this is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10x to 1000x more power.
@titusnation because it costs $2500 to transport to east coast &amp; everyone pays same
@jlgolson no prob. we care about doing what's fair &amp; just. don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong

@neiltyson it is about 10% too small, but lots of fun 
nan
@audphin @tedtalks @i_firth i love trolls
@fleijerstam @gronnbilnorge we are working hard to make that happen!
@notnahuel @snazzyq exactly. both prices are shown right next to each other &amp; lower price is *actually* the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car. in fact, for many states in the us, its way better.
@teslamiles @28delayslater @karpathy @tesla og roadster is def helping us out here with 826m miles by itself  
@altwouss @jackallisonlol @parkermolloy exactly. uaw does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
@jbsiegelmd cool, i'm glad you like it!
those who would deny climate change should ask themselves what happens if they are wrong  
run a physics sim long enough &amp; youll get intelligence
stonk tip of the day  
@wsj congratulations @murraymatt. good move by @wsj. please use matts twitter pic. essence of a good editor
@govstitt @tesla @bearagencygroup @signal_factory thanks for hosting me in tulsa today!
@schadlu i really hate patents unless critical to company survival. will publish hyperloop as open source.
obv must be more pointy tho
@mileycyrus @grimezsz 
@justpaulinelol @teslaownerssv @kristennetten @model3owners service center expansion is at max speed, so yes
@cateluvslondon @vicentes @s_padival @bourgeoisalien @jacobinmag when i was a kid, i built model airplanes, trainsets, rockets (mixed my own powder), explosives (kinda surprised i still have all fingers), a radio, lots of software. built a primitive mri machine in college.
@vp @spacex thank you on behalf of spacex
@elonmusk holding for issue resolution
@erdayastronaut @labpadre barely a scratch. :) back on the stand soon! will report conclusions as soon as we know them.
@alijamalashraf @erdayastronaut @michaelgalanin @spacex turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. our turbopumps are vertical, have 3 fan-looking things on pump side &amp; complex cross-flow. liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber.
@blueorigin best of luck tomorrow!
@pantsbobsponge @andyjstanton @timfernholz you are correct. this is a substantial underpayment compared to what ula has received.
aiming to stack ship on booster today  
@petehague @ceciliakang exactly. and nyt could have anyone post an op ed. why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this non-journalist who is also pro gasoline cars? is this just published as counterpoint? i assume nyt does believe in climate change?
@walalm yes, my absolute goal w tesla has always been mass market electric cars. will finally get there with gen3 program.
working on model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive &amp; performance versions. driving feel is amazing. aiming to release config late tonight.
@austjennings yes
@prof_wsoff great idea!
@jchybow @teslaownerssv @flcnhvy pretty much
nan
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @f_rmnn cool
@erdayastronaut @keego73 will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like f9
@ppathole @trevormahlmann @arstechnica well do several short hops to smooth out launch process, then go high altitude with body flaps
nan
@nichegamer haha

@mrbeastyt sounds cool. where are the trees being planted &amp; what kind of trees?
spacex foundry casting raptor engine manifold out of inconel  
to those who quietly help advance the causes we mutually believe in, knowing advancing the cause is the only reward: thank you
worth reading the machine stops, an old story by e. m. forster  
@spacexmr amazing
@teslatino @tesla absolutely! they rock. 
@thestaceyroy @teslamotors california cabernet
@batlag yes
but when considering savings of gas v electricity, true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride

major tesla milestone: all crash testing is complete for 5* (max) safety rating. cars can now be built for sale to public!
"kids these days are so grown up! rt ""second-graders wow audience with school production of equus""  "
@janeidyeve @slashdot yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldnt spend computing power on sound
adjusting the boring company plan: all tunnels &amp; hyperloop will prioritize pedestrians &amp; cyclists over cars
@flcnhvy basically begging for it
hi, i'm art garfunkel. have you heard the sound of silence? because, you know, it makes a sound...  
hello from the inside  
35,000
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy raptor is evolving rapidly. probably wouldnt consider it to be even v1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on super heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. it just needs crazy up force!
@wired this depressingly misleading &amp; misanthropic article came from a very brief digression at an ai conf, not from an interview with wired as is falsely implied. this is why i stopped following wired long ago. there are way better tech pubs out there.
@voxpolitico so many saved drafts. so  so many.
@aaronpaul_8 um, thanks, i like your work too
@vicentes latest autonomous hardware allows for easy computer upgrade
nan
@erdayastronaut raptor has a very high chamber pressure, which in turn allows for a large expansion ratio nozzle without flow separation at sea level
@josephthuney adding boston and providence would be the natural extension of the line
check out model s at tesla austin gallery at the domain opening today! i will stop by this eve and tomorrow morning.
@kulpability @nasa crew dragon should be physically ready &amp; at the cape in feb, but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months

@malala hi @malala! 
@teslarati feeling lucky (google tribute!) or hungry are 100% intended for max enjoyment of tesla owner. if location has destination chargers, thats a plus, but car should only route there if location is great. this will be hit &amp; miss initially, but should hone towards excellent over time.
@dmc_ryan @edoublezero love that red. we tried every possible way to make red look 3d without floating a special red tint in primary gloss layer, but no way. we have to stop whole paint shop for red &amp; it looks like an episode of dexter.
also, i am not the kale eating overlord of mars (altho kale has its moments)  
mars sky is the opposite of earth blue sunrise and sunset red during the day  
@belovedrevol making progress. maybe something to announce in a few months. have played all prior deus ex. not this one yet.
sleeving sn2 dome in the high bay  
@goesazedo yes
@martinengwicht @knightmararchon @evbite @johnrobb @tesla @elonmuskscience ive always thought that the fundamental good of tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy
@28delayslater @rationaletienne @balajis yup
defeating traffic is the ultimate boss battle
will get back to autopilot update blog tomorrow.
@incentives101 @jason @tesla yes, but  in  that were creating a generalized autonomy solution. must work in millions of strange  situations.
tesla semi unveil now nov 16. diverting resources to fix model 3 bottlenecks &amp; increase battery production for puerto rico &amp; other affected areas.
@andrewhws my grandmother was from moose jaw
@officeofomar maybe
@twittelator yup, you're right
@m4xrodri planning to have a big opening in mexico city soon and then proceed gradually to central and south america.

having dinner where a dude is hanging giant underwear with a cherry picker.   
@erdayastronaut @sciguyspace that was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low
@brijwaasi i can't hide the truth any more 
to be clear, this doesnt affect tesla website order prices. existing inventory prices are currently slightly lower than on website. this will bring them in line.
@realdarthbl we have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of qa. several parts being replaced as a result.
@secrethamper @hugsfornoah happy birthday!
should mention that the battery cells used for this are 200 wh/kg vs 250 for model s. no short term supply constraint.
@businessinsider of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. it is total nonsense.
@falcongridfin @spacex yes
@wholemarsblog tesla china rocks!
@traderjourney exactly!
@patrickdorey81 model s starts at $50k after federal rebate. gen3 will be ~$30k. need to optimize design and scale volume.

@slashdot to conserve computing power, a simulation would only render an object when it is observed
@jack_p yeah definitely
@bencam137 @fifthrocket exactly
@breedlove22 @benmezrich the thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation.   what actually matters is making goods &amp; providing services.   we should look at currencies from an information theory standpoint.   whichever has least error &amp; latency will win.

@raytech247 yes, within a region. can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. too much complexity.
@kishavanbhola @enn_nafnlaus @elonbachman there is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators
@teslaownerssv rwd is slightly more efficient, but dual motor awd is faster &amp; more agile
@itsallrisky 
@nigel_lockyer @penn @fermilab if you ever want to build a long accelerator tunnel, straight or circular, i know some people 
@hayskeys7 but rwd with electric is really good in snow (assuming all weather or winter tires), as traction control is far more precise
will post video next week of designing a rocket part with hand gestures &amp; then immediately printing it in titanium
excellent explanation of the diff betw getting to orbit vs space (suggested by @markusvonroder)  
@jasonhouge @spacex @boringcompany these are industrial strength. not recommended for use at home!
@wolfejosh 
@keithbigelow very sensible summary of supersonic flight. obvious answer is to fly high, which gives low drag &amp; low boom amplitude at ground. if boom too loud, airframe design probably wrong too.

@lanceulanoff @lea_bitterwolf @jlgolson already did. meant to go longer, but ran out of time.  
@chiledaniel priority / early access will be automatic for all owners with fsd
@westcoastbill 
to be clear, spacex is supporting a student design competition for stem, not trying to build hyperloop itself. other cos are doing latter.
@spoite @rsmoz hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
for their test drive, the motor trend team drove from la to san diego and back without recharging  
@fredericlambert it was underpriced. anyway, if you want $5k refund &amp; free supercharging turned off, we will do that.

@michaelshermer direct democracy by the people. laws must be short, as there is trickery in length. automatic expiration of rules to prevent death by bureaucracy. any rule can be removed by 40% of people to overcome inertia. freedom.
@mattiecola @ajtourville we need high brinell hardness &amp; high corrosion resistance. because of cybertrucks faceted nature, formability is not important.
perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in la for ~$10m with v1 (godot). next tunnel will be made with v2 (line-storm). v3 (prufrock), aspirationally 10x better, should be operational next year. for reference:  
@nathanielalam_m final edit was on ableton
@voltzcoreaudio yeah, will probably publish an update in six weeks or so
@alexwestergaard white-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around 1650 kelvin
@tierrauniversu it was fixed this weekend, so he should try the test again.

@engineers_feed theres a corner case where brick density is same density as water, reaching bottom due to momentum
@evafoxu @tesla sounds like we need to clear up a few things! tesla wont use this much net water on a daily basis. its possibly a rare peak usage case, but not an everyday event. also, this is not a natural forest  it was planted for use as cardboard &amp; only a small part will be used for gf4.

@arstechnica @sciguyspace were just trying to get people to mars. help would be appreciated.
@teslarati @klenderjoey hard to believe its been 15 years already.   those goals actually precede the creation of tesla by many years. goes back to probably ~1992 when i was in college. however, at the time, i thought the chance of achieving those goals was very low.
@djsnm pump is single string. some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines.
 
rocket booster reentry, landing burn &amp; leg deploy were good, but lost hull integrity right after splashdown (aka kaboom)
of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to nhtsa were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used

droneship is fine. no hull breach and repairs are minor. impact overpressure is closer to a fast fire than an explosion.
 
@petesauerbier doesnt matter yet whether you have tesla fsd computer or tesla nvidia-based computer. when it does matter later this year, tesla will switch the computers for you.

@dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght that was three years ago, before ula cancelled all medium versions of delta iv. future missions have all delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600m+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. nutty high.

tesla history trivia: we didnt actually come up with the tesla motors name. bought trademark off brad siewert for $75k in late 2004. hed originally filed for it in 1994. our alternative name was faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later.

good summary of tesla annual meeting by @katiefehren  
@teslarati @13ericralph31 this will be really important one day.   much is made of meteor impacts that destroyed most life on earth, but there were far more that merely destroyed a continent.   comets (not asteroids) are the real wild card, as were only able to track ~4600 out of  ~1 trillion.

@wholemarsblog @truth_tesla @limitingthe there are vast amounts of iron (and lithium) on earth, but much less nickel.   for global industry to scale battery production to ~10 twh/year, it needs to be mostly iron.  higher energy density of nickel only needed for very long range vehicles &amp; aircraft.

@jrussell614 will be an option to add solar power that generates 15 miles per day, possibly more. would love this to be self-powered. adding fold out solar wings would generate 30 to 40 miles per day. avg miles per day in us is 30.
@meetluis @warrez420 @wholemarsblog rawlinson was never chief engineer. he arrived after model s prototype was made, left before things got tough &amp; was only ever responsible for body engineering, not powertrain, battery, software, production or design.

should mention that the battery cells used for this are 200 wh/kg vs 250 for model s. no short term supply constraint.
