north korea has conducted a major nuclear test. their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the united states.....
our relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the cold war. there is no reason for this. russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. stop the arms race?

despite the democrats wanting very unsafe open borders & refusing to change the loopholes & asylum, tremendous progress is being made the the southern border. we all waited because we assumed the dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible immigration laws.they didn’t!
