tesla dual motor means theres a motor in front & amp ; a motor in rear . *one* is optimized for power & amp ; *one* for orbit . car rides fine even if an car breaks down . aids ensure you reach it to your goal & amp ; dont get stuck on side of road in potentially insecure considerations .

@mattbeckman us too sigh
@sawyermerritt such miraclesre beyond us
@sulka calling *this* cueless would be generous . still less energy needed for li ion batteries & amp ; gigafactory is driven by renewables anyway .
because a tesla produces no emissions &amp; filters most toxins, pollen, spores &amp; viruses, it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels
@rainmaker1973 *and* thats a very tiny fraction of the ~4 megatons of mass that the sun converts to energy every second

@royarne83 currently stops at 20 pct state of mission . this figure shall be configurable .
@spacexfan97 @kateconger thus far , so good
@scr00chy @evafoxu @tesla
@dogecoinrich
@justpaulinelol its too embarrassing
@whatsupfranks @flcnhvy that journey shall have a diff age judgment
@space_station @space station @spacex riot station looks awesome !
@kristennetten it was a seriously perverted matter , but alls that ends well .
@stephenking there are levels of pos
@commercial_crew @astrobehnken @astro_doug culmination of a truly incredible amount of work by @spacex &amp; @nasa engineering, along with support of all international @space_station countries
@teslarati @real_john_d @*real* trick d @tesla_raj @'tesla raj there will lay no loss of either
sticking workplace by 'tesla team . built whole raw general assembly line in three weeks w minimal resources . bang u guys so *much* ! pic of 1st model 3 twin car performance coming off the line
@redletterdave hardware in *all* cars . autopilot safety boasts standard . convenience features optional ( like s and x ) .
splashdown successful ! ! shipping warm boat to dragon lat long tried by p3 tracking planes # dragon
@moesargi 'tesla 2 person electric atv *will* arrive at foremost as an option for cybertruck
@cfarivar @ppathole @dawg_fan_93 @maysacha @jayprisefighter they look beautiful
@flcnhvy @sofiaan @emicimaz flux capacitance option software
@xandriteme @nasa @spacex @space_station @commercial_crew best to use a giant brake pad, aka heat shield
@robbystarbuck @tesla btw you might schedule servicing via the tesla app in *less* than a bit
now that tesla v10 0 with intelligent summon is out full self driving cost shall increase by $ ~1000 on nov 1
have late numbered to assess the *awesome* absurdist humor of waiting for godot . we so frequently wait , *without* bonking why when or where .
@mactechgenius @model3owners definitely
dragon starship and falcon 9 missile exactly completed final assembly at cape canaveral
@maisie_williams toss a bitcoin to ur witcher
@shmizer1 unhindered definitely and at *extremely* low cost
@ablack82 definitely not a logo of *any* kind
@everythinggoats
@teslarati @residentsponge only thing beyond ludicrous+ is plaid
@justinchace shall do
nan
@juanmlemao thanks :)
@engineers_feed @engineers feed physics asks the resistance of resistance because its *not* real
@owensparks_ i sure hope so !
the president of serbia amounted by our booth at the geneva car show *and* talked about nikola 'tesla
@joelsapp @rrosenbl @tesla exactly, tesla &amp; nvidia numbers described by pete were max *usable* teraops running our vision net
rocket fairing almost trained for deployment test in vacuum chamber . humanity lift on right for scale
@om respectfully disagree . larry made *awesome* moves final year , which laid the foundation for g+ to kick butt in 2012 . hes a stud .
foremost drive of a release prospect version of model 3
@waltnew cool , thanks !
@heydave7 engineering , design & amp ; general company operations absorb vast majority of my mind & amp ; are the fundamental limitation on doing more . capital allocation is outstanding but low processor payload . tesla public company duties are a significantly greater factor , but going private is n't possible now ( sigh ) .
haha actually unfeigned
already testing traffic lights , halt signs & amp ; roundabouts in evolution software . your 'tesla shall soon be subject to go *from* your garage at menage to parking at collaborate *with* no driver input at *all* .
please ignore prior tweets , as that was soul simulation to be me : ) *this* is actually me .
@heydave7 that opposes my rendering
@erinbiba ive never attacked science . definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though .
abort was had by oxygen in ground side tea teb . upper phase on standalone inside tour so does n'tlook *same* chance .
thrusters shall also fire during reentry to align touchdown point . future version shall land w helicopter precision # dragon
compared to past todays earth is miraculous & amp ; likely will be for several ten . exactly need to cover future downside chance .
42k
excession
@timsweeneyepic thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at present hence tough touchdown . weve never witnessed this *before* . next time min two engines *all* the road to the ground & amp ; restart engine 3 if engine 1 or 2 have issues .
reaching large scale rocket propulsion landing work considerably 's a crucial step towards an entirely reusable mars transport sytem
@seangvarney thats veritable & amp ; should be applauded . right moves for petroleum companies *really* to believe of themselves as energy companies but move speedily towards non-polluting sustainable energy . means lower gains short terminus but shall make them warmer long terminus .
@univercurious black scholes formula is kinda bs . huge variance between a financing approximation & amp ; fundamental physics / pure math .
@thejackbeyer @marcushouse @artzius facility engines on ship will be *same* as booster engines . this is basically raptor 2 . raptor vacuum would be entirely variant . tbd as to whether to commonize r vac with raptor 2 ( more thrust ) , keep same or tighten throat ( more isp ) . adding 3 more r vac to transport *with* max isp maybe
flight 10 of falcon 9 was good . *all* six orbcomm satellites deployed on butt .
launch on track for tomorrow morn at 10 10m cape canaveral time
@desertedpix @artifactshub *this*s how i guess most theatresre these days haha
basic premise is that its better to try to answer some of the worlds problems than to develop an aristocracy of wealth
@tierrauniversu does n t sound right . if it is , we definitely need to limit it . investigating ...
@jon_favreau. worth seeing @chefthefilm by @jon favreau . make sure to design for a meal later !
@engineers_feed @engineers feed thats how we make falcon 9
@eljaboom were almost there
@writer_01001101 @teslarati @author 01001101 all the stairwells currently shown as wood clothed shall *actually* have graffiti
@kulpability @flcnhvy @erdayastronaut @valkyriebaron11 @nasaspaceflight no, but its mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6)
@teslarati @residentsponge this shall be difficult to make as it is nt like any various vehicle
really makes me wan na buy rice krispies
@ifahaduddin @ericdiepeveen if you buy a ticketing to pit its *not* fair to charge perdition ...
awesome workplace by spacex dragon team & amp ; airborne ! to be clear , weve only done 1 multi parachute test of mk3 design , so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row .
@martx1995 @pesachlattin authentic

@worldoftesla1 yeah raw model s & amp ; x have ps5 tier entertainment computing superpower
@jkunkel2 no no
@johnnaaaaaaaaaa @kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @mayemusk operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance, it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching 100%
@didyoujustbitme @nichegamer luke im your farter .
@ppathole @nichegamer my kids loved that one whenever they were small
@atomicdeke @aarong @ajanitpv actually unfeigned
taking questions nowadays at
my twitter feed rn
cybertruck design worked partly by the spy who loved me
mn car dealers tried to adopt lawmaking to lock tesla depots . posting was exactly defeated in senate . thanks mn !
mass . judge denies car dealers 'demand to pop our little tesla storage . yay , justice prevails !
